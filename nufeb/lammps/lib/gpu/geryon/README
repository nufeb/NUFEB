NOTE: This Geryon distribution has been modified to remove files not
      necessary for the LAMMPS implementation. The full distribution

Geryon is intended to be a simple library for managing the CUDA Runtime,
CUDA Driver, and OpenCL APIs with a consistent interface:

    * Change from one API to another by simply changing the namespace
    * Use multiple APIs in the same code
    * Lightweight (only include files - no build required)
    * Manage device query and selection
    * Simple vector and matrix containers
    * Simple routines for data copy and type casting
    * Simple routines for data I/O
    * Simple classes for managing device timing
    * Simple classes for managing kernel compilation and execution
    
Geryon does not require building (although a Makefile is provided for testing 
purposes). The library is a set of header files that can be included with 
your code.
