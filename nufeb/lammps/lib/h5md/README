This directory contains the ch5md library, which is bundled with
LAMMPS under its own BSD license; see below.  This library is used
when the USER-H5MD package is included in a LAMMPS build and the dump
h5md command is invoked in a LAMMPS input script.

You can type "make lib-h5md" from the src directory to see help on how
to build this library via make commands, or you can do the same thing
by typing "python Install.py" from within this directory, or you can
do it manually by following the instructions below.

ch5md : Read and write H5MD files in C
======================================

Copyright (C) 2013-2014 Pierre de Buyl

ch5md is a set of C routines to manipulate H5MD files. H5MD is a file format
specification based on [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for storing
molecular data, whose development is found at <http://nongnu.org/h5md/>.

ch5md is developped by Pierre de Buyl and is released under the 3-clause BSD
license that can be found in the file LICENSE.

To use the h5md dump style in lammps, execute
make -f Makefile.h5cc
in this directory then
make yes-user-h5md
in the src directory of LAMMPS to rebuild LAMMPS. 

Note that you must have the h5cc compiler installed to use
Makefile.h5cc.  It should be part

If HDF5 is not in a standard system location, edit Makefile.lammps accordingly.

In the case of 2015 and more recent debian and ubuntu systems where concurrent
serial and mpi are possible, use the full platform depedent path, i.e.
`HDF5_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial`
