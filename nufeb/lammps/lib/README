This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
LAMMPS, if particular packages are included in the LAMMPS build.

Most of these directories contain code for the library; some contain
a Makefile.lammps file that points to where the library is installed
elsewhere on your system.  

In either case, the library itself must be installed and/or built
first, so that the appropriate library files exist for LAMMPS to link
against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries in this directory are the following:
