The Makefile.lammps file in this dir contains the settings to build
and link LAMMPS with # support for data compression libraries.

You should not normally need to edit Makefile.lammps unless the
LAMMPS build cannot find the system library file it specifies.

See the top of Makefile.lammps for more details.
