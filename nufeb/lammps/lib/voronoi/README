This directory contains links to the Voro++ library which is required
to use the VORONOI package and its compute voronoi/atom command in a
LAMMPS input script.

The Voro++ library is available at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++ and was
developed by Chris H. Rycroft while at UC Berkeley / Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.

You can type "make lib-voronoi" from the src directory to see help on
how to download and build this library via make commands, or you can
do the same thing by typing "python Install.py" from within this
directory, or you can do it manually by following the instructions
below.

-----------------

Instructions:

1.  Download Voro++ at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/download
    either as a tarball or via SVN, and unpack the
    tarball either in this /lib/voronoi directory
    or somewhere else on your system.

2.  Compile Voro++ from within its home directory
    % make

3.  There is no need to install Voro++ if you only wish
    to use it from LAMMPS.  You can install it if you
    wish to use it stand-alone or from other codes:
    a) install under the default /usr/local
       % sudo make install
    b) install under a user-writeable location by first
         changing the PREFIX variable in the config.mk file, then
       % make install

4.  Create two soft links in this dir (lib/voronoi)
    to the Voro++ src directory is.  E.g if you built Voro++ in this dir:
      % ln -s voro++-0.4.6/src includelink
      % ln -s voro++-0.4.6/src liblink
    These links could instead be set to the include and lib
    directories created by a Voro++ install, e.g.
      % ln -s /usr/local/include includelink
      % ln -s /usr/local/lib liblink

-----------------

When these steps are complete you can build LAMMPS
with the VORONOI package installed:

% cd lammps/src
% make yes-voronoi
% make g++ (or whatever target you wish)

Note that if you download and unpack a new LAMMPS tarball, the
"includelink" and "liblink" files will be lost and you will need to
re-create them (step 4).  If you built Voro++ in this directory (as
opposed to somewhere else on your system) and did not install it
somewhere else, you will also need to repeat steps 1,2,3.

The Makefile.lammps file in this directory is there for compatibility
with the way other libraries under the lib dir are linked with by
LAMMPS.  However, Voro++ requires no auxiliary files or settings, so
its variables are blank.
