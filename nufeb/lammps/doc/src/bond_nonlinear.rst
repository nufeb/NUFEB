bond_style nonlinear command

bond_style nonlinear/omp command
================================

Syntax
""""""


.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   bond_style nonlinear

Examples
""""""""


.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   bond_style nonlinear
   bond_coeff 2 100.0 1.1 1.4

Description
"""""""""""

The *nonlinear* bond style uses the potential

.. math::

   E = \frac{\epsilon (r - r_0)^2}{ [ \lambda^2 - (r - r_0)^2 ]}


to define an anharmonic spring :ref:`(Rector) <Rector>` of equilibrium
length :math:`r_0` and maximum extension lamda.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
:doc:`bond\_coeff <bond_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read\_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* :math:`\epsilon` (energy)
* :math:`r_0` (distance)
* :math:`\lambda` (distance)


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the MOLECULE
package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more
info.
