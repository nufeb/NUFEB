The `Authors page <http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html>`_ of the
`LAMMPS website <lws_>`_ has a comprehensive list of all the individuals
who have contributed code for a new feature or command or tool to
LAMMPS.


----------


The following folks deserve special recognition.  Many of the packages
they have written are unique for an MD code and LAMMPS would not be as
general-purpose as it is without their expertise and efforts.

* Metin Aktulga (MSU), USER-REAXC package for C version of ReaxFF
* Mike Brown (Intel), GPU and USER-INTEL packages
* Colin Denniston (U Western Ontario), USER-LB package
* Georg Ganzenmuller (EMI), USER-SMD and USER-SPH packages
* Andres Jaramillo-Botero (Caltech), USER-EFF package for electron force field
* Reese Jones (Sandia) and colleagues, USER-ATC package for atom/continuum coupling
* Christoph Kloss (DCS Computing), LIGGGHTS code for granular materials, built on top of LAMMPS
* Rudra Mukherjee (JPL), POEMS package for articulated rigid body motion
* Trung Ngyuen (Northwestern U), GPU and RIGID and BODY packages
* Mike Parks (Sandia), PERI package for Peridynamics
* Roy Pollock (LLNL), Ewald and PPPM solvers
* Christian Trott (Sandia), USER-CUDA and KOKKOS packages
* Ilya Valuev (JIHT), USER-AWPMD package for wave packet MD
* Greg Wagner (Northwestern U), MEAM package for MEAM potential

As discussed on the `History page <http://lammps.sandia.gov/history.html>`_ of the website, LAMMPS
originated as a cooperative project between DOE labs and industrial
partners.  Folks involved in the design and testing of the original
version of LAMMPS were the following:

* John Carpenter (Mayo Clinic, formerly at Cray Research)
* Terry Stouch (Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, formerly at Bristol Myers Squibb)
* Steve Lustig (Dupont)
* Jim Belak and Roy Pollock (LLNL)
