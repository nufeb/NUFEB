LAMMPS open-source license
==========================

LAMMPS is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the `GNU Public License <gnu_>`_, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.

LAMMPS comes with no warranty of any kind.  As each source file states
in its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed free-of-
charge, under the terms of the `GNU Public License <gnu_>`_ (GPL).  This
is often referred to as open-source distribution - see
`www.gnu.org <gnuorg_>`_ or `www.opensource.org <opensource_>`_.  The legal
text of the GPL is in the LICENSE file included in the LAMMPS
distribution.

.. _gnuorg: http://www.gnu.org



.. _opensource: http://www.opensource.org



Here is a summary of what the GPL means for LAMMPS users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend LAMMPS in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of LAMMPS, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
LAMMPS.

(3) If you release any code that includes LAMMPS source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.

(4) If you give LAMMPS files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.
