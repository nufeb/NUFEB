Description
"""""""""""

The *distance* improper style uses the potential

   :align: center

where d is the distance between the central atom and the plane formed
by the other three atoms.  If the 4 atoms in an improper quadruplet
(listed in the data file read by the :doc:`read\_data <read_data>`
command) are ordered I,J,K,L then the I-atom is assumed to be the
central atom.

Note that defining 4 atoms to interact in this way, does not mean that
bonds necessarily exist between I-J, J-K, or K-L, as they would in a
linear dihedral. Normally, the bonds I-J, I-K, I-L would exist for an
improper to be defined between the 4 atoms.

The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the improper\_coeff command as in the example above, or in the data
file or restart files read by the read\_data or read\_restart commands:

* K\_2 (energy/distance\^2)
* K\_4 (energy/distance\^4)

This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc
page for more info.
