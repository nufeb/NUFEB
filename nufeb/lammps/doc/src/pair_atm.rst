Description
"""""""""""

The *atm* style computes a 3-body :ref:`Axilrod-Teller-Muto <Axilrod>`
potential for the energy E of a system of atoms as

.. image:: Eqs/pair_atm.jpg
   :align: center

where nu is the three-body interaction strength.  The distances
between pairs of atoms r12, r23, r31 and the angles gamma1, gamma2,
gamma3 are as shown in this diagram:

.. image:: JPG/pair_atm_dia.jpg
   :align: center

Note that for the interaction between a triplet of atoms I,J,K, there
is no "central" atom.  The interaction is symmetric with respect to
permutation of the three atoms. Thus the nu value is
the same for all those permutations of the atom types of I,J,K
and needs to be specified only once, as discussed below.

The *atm* potential is typically used in combination with a two-body
potential using the :doc:`pair\_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`
command as in the example above.

The potential for a triplet of atom is calculated only if all 3
distances r12, r23, r31 between the 3 atoms satisfy rIJ < cutoff.
In addition, the product of the 3 distances r12\*r23\*r31 <
cutoff\_triple\^3 is required, which excludes from calculation the
triplets with small contribution to the interaction.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the :doc:`pair\_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples
above, or in the restart files read by the
:doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* K = atom type of the third atom (1 to Ntypes)
* nu = prefactor (energy/distance\^9 units)

K can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value can
be used, as in the 2nd example above.  J <= K is required.  LAMMPS
sets the coefficients for the other 5 symmetric interactions to the
same values.  E.g. if I = 1, J = 2, K = 3, then these 6 values are set
to the specified nu: nu123, nu132, nu213, nu231, nu312, nu321.  This
enforces the symmetry discussed above.

A wildcard asterisk can be used for K to set the coefficients for
multiple triplets of atom types.  This takes the form "\*" or "\*n" or
"n\*" or "m\*n".  If N = the number of atom types, then an asterisk with
no numeric values means all types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk
means all types from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means
all types from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types
from m to n (inclusive).  Note that only type triplets with J <= K are
considered; if asterisks imply type triplets where K < J, they are
ignored.

Note that a pair\_coeff command can override a previous setting for the
same I,J,K triplet.  For example, these commands set nu for all I,J.K
triplets, then overwrite nu for just the I,J,K = 2,3,4 triplet:


.. parsed-literal::

   pair_coeff \* \* \* 0.25
   pair_coeff 2 3 4 0.1

Note that for a simulation with a single atom type, only a single
entry is required, e.g.


.. parsed-literal::

   pair_coeff 1 1 1 0.25

For a simulation with two atom types, four pair\_coeff commands will
specify all possible nu values:


.. parsed-literal::

   pair_coeff 1 1 1 nu1
   pair_coeff 1 1 2 nu2
   pair_coeff 1 2 2 nu3
   pair_coeff 2 2 2 nu4

For a simulation with three atom types, ten pair\_coeff commands will
specify all possible nu values:


.. parsed-literal::

   pair_coeff 1 1 1 nu1
   pair_coeff 1 1 2 nu2
   pair_coeff 1 1 3 nu3
   pair_coeff 1 2 2 nu4
   pair_coeff 1 2 3 nu5
   pair_coeff 1 3 3 nu6
   pair_coeff 2 2 2 nu7
   pair_coeff 2 2 3 nu8
   pair_coeff 2 3 3 nu9
   pair_coeff 3 3 3 nu10

By default the nu value for all triplets is set to 0.0.  Thus it is
not required to provide pair\_coeff commands that enumerate triplet
interactions for all K types.  If some I,J,K combination is not
specified, then there will be no 3-body ATM interactions for that
combination and all its permutations.  However, as with all pair
styles, it is required to specify a pair\_coeff command for all I,J
combinations, else an error will result.


----------


**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**\ :

This pair styles do not support the :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>`
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style writes its information to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`, so pair\_style and pair\_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
However, if the *atm* potential is used in combination with other
potentials using the :doc:`pair\_style hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>`
command then pair\_coeff commands need to be re-specified
in the restart input script.

This pair style can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run\_style respa <run_style>` command.  It does not support the
*inner*\ , *middle*\ , *outer* keywords.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This pair style is part of the MANYBODY package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.
