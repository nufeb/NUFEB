Description
"""""""""""

The *harmonic/shift* bond style is a shifted harmonic bond that uses
the potential

.. math::

   E = \frac{U_{\text{min}}}{(r_0-r_c)^2} \left[ (r-r_0)^2-(r_c-r_0)^2 \right]


where :math:`r_0` is the equilibrium bond distance, and :math:`r_c` the critical distance.
The potential is :math:`-U_{\text{min}}` at :math:`r0` and zero at :math:`r_c`. The spring constant is
:math:`k = U_{\text{min}} / [ 2 (r_0-r_c)^2]`.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
:doc:`bond\_coeff <bond_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read\_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* :math:`U_{\text{min}}` (energy)

* :math:`r_0` (distance)

* :math:`r_c` (distance)


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER-MISC package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc
