:doc:`What is a LAMMPS version? <Manual_version>`

LAMMPS stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code with a focus
on materials modeling.  It was designed to run efficiently on parallel
computers.  It was developed originally at Sandia National
Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility.  The majority of
funding for LAMMPS has come from the US Department of Energy (DOE).
LAMMPS is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of
the GNU Public License (GPL).

The `LAMMPS website <lws_>`_ has a variety of information about the code.
It includes links to an on-line version of this manual, a `mailing list <http://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html>`_ where users can post
questions, and a `GitHub site <https://github.com/lammps/lammps>`_ where
all LAMMPS development is coordinated.


----------


The content for this manual is part of the LAMMPS distribution.  You
can build a local copy of the Manual as HTML pages or a PDF file, by
following the steps on the :doc:`Manual build <Manual_build>` doc page.
There is also a `Developer.pdf <Developer.pdf>`_ document which gives
a brief description of the basic code structure of LAMMPS.

Once you are familiar with LAMMPS, you may want to bookmark :doc:`this page <Commands>` since it gives quick access to a doc page for
every LAMMPS command.
