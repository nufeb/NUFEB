Description
"""""""""""

Style *ufm* computes pairwise interactions using the Uhlenbeck-Ford model (UFM) potential :ref:`(Paula Leite2016) <PL2>` which is given by

.. image:: Eqs/pair_ufm.jpg
   :align: center

where rc is the cutoff, sigma is a distance-scale and epsilon is an energy-scale, i.e., a product of Boltzmann constant kB, temperature T and the Uhlenbeck-Ford p-parameter which is responsible
to control the softness of the interactions :ref:`(Paula Leite2017) <PL1>`.
This model is useful as a reference system for fluid-phase free-energy calculations :ref:`(Paula Leite2016) <PL2>`.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the :doc:`pair\_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read\_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>`
commands, or by mixing as described below:

* epsilon (energy units)
* sigma (distance units)
* cutoff (distance units)

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global *ufm*
cutoff is used.

The :doc:`fix adapt <fix_adapt>` command can be used to vary epsilon and sigma for this pair style over the course of a simulation, in which case
pair\_coeff settings for epsilon and sigma must still be specified, but will be
overridden.  For example these commands will vary the prefactor epsilon for
all pairwise interactions from 10.0 at the beginning to 100.0 at the end
of a run:


.. parsed-literal::

   variable prefactor equal ramp(10,100)
   fix 1 all adapt 1 pair ufm epsilon \* \* v_prefactor

.. note::

   The thermodynamic integration procedure can be performed with this potential using :doc:`fix adapt <fix_adapt>`. This command will rescale the force on each atom by varying a scale variable, which always starts with value 1.0. The syntax is the same described above, however, changing epsilon to scale. A detailed explanation of how to use this command and perform nonequilibrium thermodynamic integration in LAMMPS is given in the paper by :ref:`(Freitas) <Freitas2>`.


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**\ :

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the A coefficient and cutoff
distance for this pair style can be mixed.  A is always mixed via a
*geometric* rule.  The cutoff is mixed according to the pair\_modify
mix value.  The default mix value is *geometric*\ .  See the
"pair\_modify" command for details.

This pair style support the :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>` shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>` table and tail are not relevant for this
pair style.

This pair style does not support the :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>` tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and pressure.

This pair style writes its information to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`, so pair\_style and pair\_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run\_style respa <run_style>` command.  It does not support the
*inner*\ , *middle*\ , *outer* keywords.
