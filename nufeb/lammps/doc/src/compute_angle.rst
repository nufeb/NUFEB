.. index:: compute angle

compute angle command
=====================

Syntax
""""""


.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID angle

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* angle = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""


.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all angle

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that extracts the angle energy calculated by each
of the angle sub-styles used in the  "angle\_style
hybrid" angle\_hybrid.html command.  These values are made accessible
for output or further processing by other commands.  The group
specified for this command is ignored.

This compute is useful when using :doc:`angle\_style hybrid <angle_hybrid>` if you want to know the portion of the total
energy contributed by one or more of the hybrid sub-styles.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a global vector of length N where N is the
number of sub\_styles defined by the :doc:`angle\_style hybrid <angle_style>` command, which can be accessed by indices
1-N.  These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar
or vector values from a compute as input.  See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector values are "extensive" and will be in energy
:doc:`units <units>`.

Restrictions
