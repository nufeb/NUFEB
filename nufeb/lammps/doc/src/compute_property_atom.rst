Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that simply stores atom attributes for each atom
in the group.  This is useful so that the values can be used by other
:doc:`output commands <Howto_output>` that take computes as inputs.  See
for example, the :doc:`compute reduce <compute_reduce>`, :doc:`fix ave/atom <fix_ave_atom>`, :doc:`fix ave/histo <fix_ave_histo>`, :doc:`fix ave/chunk <fix_ave_chunk>`, and :doc:`atom-style variable <variable>`
commands.

The list of possible attributes is the same as that used by the :doc:`dump custom <dump>` command, which describes their meaning, with some
additional quantities that are only defined for certain :doc:`atom styles <atom_style>`.  Basically, this augmented list gives an
input script access to any per-atom quantity stored by LAMMPS.

The values are stored in a per-atom vector or array as discussed
below.  Zeroes are stored for atoms not in the specified group or for
quantities that are not defined for a particular particle in the group
(e.g. *shapex* if the particle is not an ellipsoid).

The additional quantities only accessible via this command, and not
directly via the :doc:`dump custom <dump>` command, are as follows.

*Shapex*\ , *shapey*\ , and *shapez* are defined for ellipsoidal particles
and define the 3d shape of each particle.

*Quatw*\ , *quati*\ , *quatj*\ , and *quatk* are defined for ellipsoidal
particles and body particles and store the 4-vector quaternion
representing the orientation of each particle.  See the :doc:`set <set>`
command for an explanation of the quaternion vector.

*End1x*\ , *end1y*\ , *end1z*\ , *end2x*\ , *end2y*\ , *end2z*\ , are defined for
line segment particles and define the end points of each line segment.

*Corner1x*\ , *corner1y*\ , *corner1z*\ , *corner2x*\ , *corner2y*\ ,
*corner2z*\ , *corner3x*\ , *corner3y*\ , *corner3z*\ , are defined for
triangular particles and define the corner points of each triangle.

*Nbonds* is available for all molecular atom styles and refers to the
number of explicit bonds assigned to an atom.  Note that if the
:doc:`newton bond <newton>` command is set to *on*\ , which is the
default, then every bond in the system is assigned to only one of the
two atoms in the bond.  Thus a bond between atoms I,J may be tallied
for either atom I or atom J.  If :doc:`newton bond off <newton>` is set,
it will be tallied with both atom I and atom J.

The *i\_name* and *d\_name* attributes refer to custom integer and
floating-point properties that have been added to each atom via the
:doc:`fix property/atom <fix_property_atom>` command.  When that command
is used specific names are given to each attribute which are what is
specified as the "name" portion of *i\_name* or *d\_name*.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a per-atom vector or per-atom array depending
on the number of input values.  If a single input is specified, a
per-atom vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are specified, a
per-atom array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector or array values will be in whatever :doc:`units <units>` the
corresponding attribute is in, e.g. velocity units for vx, charge
units for q, etc.

For the spin quantities, sp is in the units of the Bohr magneton, spx,
spy, and spz are unitless quantities, and fmx, fmy and fmz are given
in rad/THz.
