Description
"""""""""""

Fix *wall/ees* bounds the simulation domain on one or more of its
faces with a flat wall that interacts with the ellipsoidal atoms in the
group by generating a force on the atom in a direction perpendicular to
the wall and a torque parallel with the wall.  The energy of
wall-particle interactions E is given by:

.. image:: Eqs/fix_wall_ees.jpg
   :align: center

Introduced by Babadi and Ejtehadi in :ref:`(Babadi) <BabadiEjtehadi>`. Here,
*r* is the distance from the particle to the wall at position *coord*\ ,
and Rc is the *cutoff* distance at which the particle and wall no
longer interact. Also, sigma\_n is the distance between center of
ellipsoid and the nearest point of its surface to the wall. The energy
of the wall is:

.. image:: JPG/fix_wall_ees_image.jpg
   :align: center

Details of using this command and specifications are the same as
fix/wall command. You can also find an example in USER/ees/ under
examples/ directory.

The prefactor *epsilon* can be thought of as an
effective Hamaker constant with energy units for the strength of the
ellipsoid-wall interaction.  More specifically, the *epsilon* pre-factor
= 8 \* pi\^2 \* rho\_wall \* rho\_ellipsoid \* epsilon
\* sigma\_a \* sigma\_b \* sigma\_c, where epsilon is the LJ parameters for
the constituent LJ particles and sigma\_a, sigma\_b, and sigma\_c are radii
of ellipsoidal particles. Rho\_wall and rho\_ellipsoid are the number
density of the constituent particles, in the wall and ellipsoid
respectively, in units of 1/volume.

.. note::

   You must insure that r is always bigger than sigma\_n for
   all particles in the group, or LAMMPS will generate an error.  This
   means you cannot start your simulation with particles touching the wall
   position *coord* (r = sigma\_n) or with particles penetrating the wall
   (0 =< r < sigma\_n) or with particles on the wrong side of the
   wall (r < 0).

Fix *wall/region/ees* treats the surface of the geometric region defined
by the *region-ID* as a bounding wall which interacts with nearby
ellipsoidal particles according to the EES potential introduced above.

Other details of this command are the same as for the :doc:`fix wall/region <fix_wall_region>` command.  One may also find an example
of using this fix in the examples/USER/misc/ees/ directory.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

This fix requires that atoms be ellipsoids as defined by the
:doc:`atom\_style ellipsoid <atom_style>` command.
