Description
"""""""""""

The *umbrella* improper style uses the following potential, which is
commonly referred to as a classic inversion and used in the
:doc:`DREIDING <Howto_bioFF>` force field:

.. image:: Eqs/improper_umbrella.jpg
   :align: center

where K is the force constant and omega is the angle between the IL
axis and the IJK plane:

.. image:: JPG/umbrella.jpg
   :align: center

If omega0 = 0 the potential term has a minimum for the planar
structure.  Otherwise it has two minima at +/- omega0, with a barrier
in between.

See :ref:`(Mayo) <umbrella-Mayo>` for a description of the DREIDING force field.

The following coefficients must be defined for each improper type via
the :doc:`improper\_coeff <improper_coeff>` command as in the example
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read\_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>`
commands:

* K (energy)
* omega0 (degrees)


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This improper style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page
for more info.
