Build LAMMPS
************

LAMMPS can be built as an executable or library from source code via
either traditional makefiles (which may require manual editing)
for use with GNU make or gmake, or a build environment generated by CMake
(Unix Makefiles, Xcode, Visual Studio, KDevelop or more).  As an
alternative you can download a package with pre-built executables
as described on the :doc:`Install <Install>` doc page.
