Description
"""""""""""

The *fene* bond style uses the potential

.. math::

   E = -0.5 K R_0^2  \ln \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{r}{R_0}\right)^2\right] + 4 \epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6 \right] + \epsilon


to define a finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential
:ref:`(Kremer) <fene-Kremer>`, used for bead-spring polymer models.  The first
term is attractive, the 2nd Lennard-Jones term is repulsive.  The
first term extends to :math:`R_0`, the maximum extent of the bond.  The 2nd
term is cutoff at :math:`2^\frac{1}{6} \sigma`, the minimum of the LJ potential.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
:doc:`bond\_coeff <bond_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read\_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* :math:`K` (energy/distance\^2)
* :math:`R_0` (distance)
* :math:`\epsilon` (energy)
* :math:`\sigma` (distance)


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the MOLECULE
package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more
info.

You typically should specify :doc:`special\_bonds fene <special_bonds>`
or :doc:`special\_bonds lj/coul 0 1 1 <special_bonds>` to use this bond
style.  LAMMPS will issue a warning it that's not the case.
