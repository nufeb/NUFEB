Description
"""""""""""

Perform constant NVE integration to update position, velocity, and
angular velocity for finite-size spherical particles in the group each
timestep.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a system trajectory
consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.

This fix differs from the :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` command, which
assumes point particles and only updates their position and velocity.

If the *update* keyword is used with the *dipole* value, then the
orientation of the dipole moment of each particle is also updated
during the time integration.  This option should be used for models
where a dipole moment is assigned to finite-size particles,
e.g. spheroids via use of the :doc:`atom\_style hybrid sphere dipole <atom_style>` command.

The default dipole orientation integrator can be changed to the
Dullweber-Leimkuhler-McLachlan integration scheme
:ref:`(Dullweber) <nh-Dullweber>` when using *update* with the value
*dipole/dlm*\ . This integrator is symplectic and time-reversible,
giving better energy conservation and allows slightly longer timesteps
at only a small additional computational cost.

If the *disc* keyword is used, then each particle is treated as a 2d
disc (circle) instead of as a sphere.  This is only possible for 2d
simulations, as defined by the :doc:`dimension <dimension>` keyword.
The only difference between discs and spheres in this context is their
moment of inertia, as used in the time integration.


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

**Restart, fix\_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:**

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix\_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This fix requires that atoms store torque and angular velocity (omega)
and a radius as defined by the :doc:`atom\_style sphere <atom_style>`
command.  If the *dipole* keyword is used, then they must also store a
dipole moment as defined by the :doc:`atom\_style dipole <atom_style>`
command.

All particles in the group must be finite-size spheres.  They cannot
be point particles.

Use of the *disc* keyword is only allowed for 2d simulations, as
defined by the :doc:`dimension <dimension>` keyword.
