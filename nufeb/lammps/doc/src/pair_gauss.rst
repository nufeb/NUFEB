Description
"""""""""""

Style *gauss* computes a tethering potential of the form

.. image:: Eqs/pair_gauss.jpg
   :align: center

between an atom and its corresponding tether site which will typically
be a frozen atom in the simulation.  Rc is the cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the :doc:`pair\_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read\_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>`
commands:

* A (energy units)
* B (1/distance\^2 units)
* cutoff (distance units)

The last coefficient is optional. If not specified, the global cutoff
is used.

Style *gauss/cut* computes a generalized Gaussian interaction potential
between pairs of particles:

.. image:: Eqs/pair_gauss_cut.jpg
   :align: center

where H determines together with the standard deviation sigma\_h the
peak height of the Gaussian function, and r\_mh the peak position.
Examples of the use of the Gaussian potentials include implicit
solvent simulations of salt ions :ref:`(Lenart) <Lenart2>` and of surfactants
:ref:`(Jusufi) <Jusufi2>`.  In these instances the Gaussian potential mimics
the hydration barrier between a pair of particles. The hydration
barrier is located at r\_mh and has a width of sigma\_h. The prefactor
determines the height of the potential barrier.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the :doc:`pair\_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the example above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read\_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read\_restart <read_restart>`
commands:

* H (energy \* distance units)
* r\_mh (distance units)
* sigma\_h (distance units)
* cutoff (distance units)

The last coefficient is optional. If not specified, the global cutoff
is used.


----------


Styles with a *gpu*\ , *intel*\ , *kk*\ , *omp*\ , or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :doc:`-suffix command-line switch <Run_options>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
:doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :doc:`Speed packages <Speed_packages>` doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**\ :

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the A, B, H, sigma\_h, r\_mh
parameters, and the cutoff distance for these pair styles can be mixed:
A (energy units)
sqrt(1/B) (distance units, see below)
H (energy units)
sigma\_h (distance units)
r\_mh (distance units)
cutoff (distance units):ul

The default mix value is *geometric*\ .
Only *arithmetic* and *geometric* mix values are supported.
See the "pair\_modify" command for details.

The A and H parameters are mixed using the same rules normally
used to mix the "epsilon" parameter in a Lennard Jones interaction.
The sigma\_h, r\_mh, and the cutoff distance are mixed using the same
rules used to mix the "sigma" parameter in a Lennard Jones interaction.
The B parameter is converted to a distance (sigma), before mixing
(using sigma=B\^-0.5), and converted back to a coefficient
afterwards (using B=sigma\^2).
Negative A values are converted to positive A values (using abs(A))
before mixing, and converted back after mixing
(by multiplying by min(sign(Ai),sign(Aj))).
This way, if either particle is repulsive (if Ai<0 or Aj<0),
then the default interaction between both particles will be repulsive.

The *gauss* style does not support the :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>`
shift option. There is no effect due to the Gaussian well beyond the
cutoff; hence reasonable cutoffs need to be specified.

The *gauss/cut* style supports the :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>` shift
option for the energy of the Gauss-potential portion of the pair
interaction.

The :doc:`pair\_modify <pair_modify>` table and tail options are not
relevant for these pair styles.

These pair styles write their information to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`, so pair\_style and pair\_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These pair styles can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run\_style respa <run_style>` command.  They do not support the
*inner*\ , *middle*\ , *outer* keywords.

The *gauss* pair style tallies an "occupancy" count of how many Gaussian-well
sites have an atom within the distance at which the force is a maximum
= sqrt(0.5/b).  This quantity can be accessed via the :doc:`compute pair <compute_pair>` command as a vector of values of length 1.

To print this quantity to the log file (with a descriptive column
heading) the following commands could be included in an input script:


.. parsed-literal::

   compute gauss all pair gauss
   variable occ equal c_gauss[1]
   thermo_style custom step temp epair v_occ

Restrictions
""""""""""""


The *gauss/cut* style is part of the "user-misc" package. It is only
enabled if LAMMPS is build with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.
