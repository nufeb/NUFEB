Description
"""""""""""

The fix calculates a new stable time increment for use with the SMD
time integrators.

The stable time increment is based on multiple conditions. For the SPH
pair styles, a CFL criterion (Courant, Friedrichs & Lewy, 1928) is
evaluated, which determines the speed of sound cannot propagate
further than a typical spacing between particles within a single time
step to ensure no information is lost. For the contact pair styles, a
linear analysis of the pair potential determines a stable maximum time
step.

This fix inquires the minimum stable time increment across all
particles contained in the group for which this fix is defined. An
additional safety factor *s\_fact* is applied to the time increment.

Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Restart, fix\_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:**

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.
