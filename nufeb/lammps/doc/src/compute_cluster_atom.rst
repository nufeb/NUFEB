Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that assigns each atom a cluster, fragment,
or aggregate ID.

A cluster is defined as a set of atoms, each of which is within the
cutoff distance from one or more other atoms in the cluster.  If an
atom has no neighbors within the cutoff distance, then it is a 1-atom
cluster.

A fragment is similarly defined as a set of atoms, each of
which has an explicit bond (i.e. defined via a :doc:`data file <read_data>`,
the :doc:`create\_bonds <create_bonds>` command, or through fixes like
:doc:`fix bond/create <fix_bond_create>`, :doc:`fix bond/swap <fix_bond_swap>`,
or :doc:`fix bond/break <fix_bond_break>`).  The cluster ID or fragment ID
of every atom in the cluster will be set to the smallest atom ID of any atom
in the cluster or fragment, respectively.

An aggregate is defined by combining the rules for clusters and
fragments, i.e. a set of atoms, where each of it is within the cutoff
distance from one or more atoms within a fragment that is part of
the same cluster. This measure can be used to track molecular assemblies
like micelles.

Only atoms in the compute group are clustered and assigned cluster
IDs. Atoms not in the compute group are assigned a cluster ID = 0.
For fragments, only bonds where **both** atoms of the bond are included
in the compute group are assigned to fragments, so that only fragments
are detected where **all** atoms are in the compute group. Thus atoms
may be included in the compute group, yes still have a fragment ID of 0.

For computes *cluster/atom* and *aggregate/atom* the neighbor list needed
to compute this quantity is constructed each time the calculation is
performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms is dumped).  Thus it can be
inefficient to compute/dump this quantity too frequently or to have
multiple compute/dump commands, each of a *cluster/atom* or
*aggregate/atom* style.

.. note::

   If you have a bonded system, then the settings of
   :doc:`special\_bonds <special_bonds>` command can remove pairwise
   interactions between atoms in the same bond, angle, or dihedral.  This
   is the default setting for the :doc:`special\_bonds <special_bonds>`
   command, and means those pairwise interactions do not appear in the
   neighbor list.  Because this fix uses the neighbor list, it also means
   those pairs will not be included when computing the clusters. This
   does not apply when using long-range coulomb (\ *coul/long*\ , *coul/msm*\ ,
   *coul/wolf* or similar.  One way to get around this would be to set
   special\_bond scaling factors to very tiny numbers that are not exactly
   zero (e.g. 1.0e-50). Another workaround is to write a dump file, and
   use the :doc:`rerun <rerun>` command to compute the clusters for
   snapshots in the dump file.  The rerun script can use a
   :doc:`special\_bonds <special_bonds>` command that includes all pairs in
   the neighbor list.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values will be an ID > 0, as explained above.
