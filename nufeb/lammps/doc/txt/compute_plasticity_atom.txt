compute plasticity/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID plasticity/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in compute command
plasticity/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all plasticity/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom plasticity for each
atom in a group.  This is a quantity relevant for "Peridynamics
models"_pair_peri.html.  See "this document"_PDF/PDLammps_overview.pdf
for an overview of LAMMPS commands for Peridynamics modeling.

The plasticity for a Peridynamic particle is the so-called consistency
parameter (lambda).  For elastic deformation lambda = 0, otherwise
lambda > 0 for plastic deformation.  For details, see
"(Mitchell)"_#Mitchell and the PDF doc included in the LAMMPS
distribution in "doc/PDF/PDLammps_EPS.pdf"_PDF/PDLammps_EPS.pdf.

This command can be invoked for one of the Peridynamic "pair
styles"_pair_peri.html: peri/eps.

The plasticity value will be 0.0 for atoms not in the specified
compute group.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values are unitless numbers (lambda) >= 0.0.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the PERI package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Related commands:]

"compute damage/atom"_compute_damage_atom.html,
"compute dilatation/atom"_compute_dilatation_atom.html

[Default:] none
