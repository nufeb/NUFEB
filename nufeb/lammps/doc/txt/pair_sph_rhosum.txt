pair_style sph/rhosum command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style sph/rhosum Nstep :pre

Nstep = timestep interval :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style sph/rhosum 10
pair_coeff * * 2.4 :pre

[Description:]

The sph/rhosum style computes the local particle mass density rho for
SPH particles by kernel function interpolation, every Nstep timesteps.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/sph/SPH_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using SPH in
LAMMPS.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above.

h (distance units) :ul

:line

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This style does not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

This style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift, table, and tail options.

This style does not write information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and
pair_coeff commands in an input script that reads a restart file.

This style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the "run_style
respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the {inner},
{middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the USER-SPH package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Related commands:]

"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html, pair_sph/taitwater

[Default:] none
