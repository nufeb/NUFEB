fix eos/cv command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID eos/cv cv :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
eos/cv = style name of this fix command
cv = constant-volume heat capacity (energy/temperature units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all eos/cv 0.01 :pre

[Description:]

Fix {eos/cv} applies a mesoparticle equation of state to relate the
particle internal energy (u_i) to the particle internal temperature
(dpdTheta_i).  The {eos/cv} mesoparticle equation of state requires
the constant-volume heat capacity, and is defined as follows:

:c,image(Eqs/fix_eos-cv.jpg)

where Cv is the constant-volume heat capacity, u_cond is the internal
conductive energy, and u_mech is the internal mechanical energy.  Note
that alternative definitions of the mesoparticle equation of state are
possible.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the USER-DPD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This command also requires use of the "atom_style dpd"_atom_style.html
command.

[Default:] none
