compute smd/internal/energy command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/internal/energy :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/smd/internal/energy = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/internal/energy :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation which outputs the per-particle enthalpy, i.e.,
the sum of potential energy and heat.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output Info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector values will be given in "units"_units.html of energy.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info. This compute can
only be used for particles which interact via the updated Lagrangian
or total Lagrangian SPH pair styles.
