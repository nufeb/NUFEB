compute tdpd/cc/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID tdpd/cc/atom index :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
tdpd/cc/atom = style name of this compute command
index = index of chemical species (1 to Nspecies) :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all tdpd/cc/atom 2 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom chemical
concentration of a specified species for each tDPD particle in a
group.

The chemical concentration of each species is defined as the number of
molecules carried by a tDPD particle for dilute solution.  For more
details see "(Li2015)"_#Li2015a.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input. See the
"Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of LAMMPS
output options.

The per-atom vector values will be in the units of chemical species
per unit mass.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-MESO package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Default:] none
