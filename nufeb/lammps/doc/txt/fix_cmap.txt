fix cmap command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID cmap filename :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
cmap = style name of this fix command
filename = force-field file with CMAP coefficients :ul

[Examples:]

fix            myCMAP all cmap ../potentials/cmap36.data
read_data      proteinX.data fix myCMAP crossterm CMAP
fix_modify     myCMAP energy yes :pre

[Description:]

This command enables CMAP cross-terms to be added to simulations which
use the CHARMM force field.  These are relevant for any CHARMM model
of a peptide or protein sequences that is 3 or more amino-acid
residues long; see "(Buck)"_#Buck and "(Brooks)"_#Brooks2 for details,
including the analytic energy expressions for CMAP interactions.  The
CMAP cross-terms add additional potential energy contributions to pairs
of overlapping phi-psi dihedrals of amino-acids, which are important
to properly represent their conformational behavior.

The examples/cmap directory has a sample input script and data file
for a small peptide, that illustrates use of the fix cmap command.

As in the example above, this fix should be used before reading a data
file that contains a listing of CMAP interactions.  The {filename}
specified should contain the CMAP parameters for a particular version
of the CHARMM force field.  Two such files are including in the
lammps/potentials directory: charmm22.cmap and charmm36.cmap.

The data file read by the "read_data" must contain the topology of all
the CMAP interactions, similar to the topology data for bonds, angles,
dihedrals, etc.  Specially it should have a line like this
in its header section:

N crossterms :pre

where N is the number of CMAP cross-terms.  It should also have a section
in the body of the data file like this with N lines:

CMAP :pre

       1       1       8      10      12      18      20
       2       5      18      20      22      25      27
       \[...\]
       N       3     314     315     317      318    330 :pre

The first column is an index from 1 to N to enumerate the CMAP terms;
it is ignored by LAMMPS.  The 2nd column is the "type" of the
interaction; it is an index into the CMAP force field file.  The
remaining 5 columns are the atom IDs of the atoms in the two 4-atom
dihedrals that overlap to create the CMAP 5-body interaction.  Note
that the "crossterm" and "CMAP" keywords for the header and body
sections match those specified in the read_data command following the
data file name; see the "read_data"_read_data.html doc page for
more details.

A data file containing CMAP cross-terms can be generated from a PDB
file using the charmm2lammps.pl script in the tools/ch2lmp directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  The script must be invoked with the
optional "-cmap" flag to do this; see the tools/ch2lmp/README file for
more information.

The potential energy associated with CMAP interactions can be output
as described below.  It can also be included in the total potential
energy of the system, as output by the
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command, if the "fix_modify
energy"_fix_modify.html command is used, as in the example above.  See
the note below about how to include the CMAP energy when performing an
"energy minimization"_minimize.html.

:line

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix writes the list of CMAP cross-terms to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  See the "read_restart"_read_restart.html command
for info on how to re-specify a fix in an input script that reads a
restart file, so that the operation of the fix continues in an
uninterrupted fashion.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option is supported by this
fix to add the potential "energy" of the CMAP interactions system's
potential energy as part of "thermodynamic output"_thermo_style.html.

The "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {virial} option is supported by this
fix to add the contribution due to the interaction between atoms to
the system's virial as part of "thermodynamic output"_thermo_style.html.
The default is {virial yes}

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
"output commands"_Howto_output.html.  The scalar is the potential
energy discussed above.  The scalar value calculated by this fix is
"extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.

NOTE: If you want the potential energy associated with the CMAP terms
forces to be included in the total potential energy of the system (the
quantity being minimized), you MUST enable the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html {energy} option for this fix.

[Restrictions:]

To function as expected this fix command must be issued {before} a
"read_data"_read_data.html command but {after} a
"read_restart"_read_restart.html command.

This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the MOLECULE
package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.

[Default:] none
