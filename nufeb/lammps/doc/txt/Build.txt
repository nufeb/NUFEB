Build LAMMPS :h2

LAMMPS can be built as an executable or library from source code via
either traditional makefiles (which may require manual editing)
for use with GNU make or gmake, or a build environment generated by CMake
(Unix Makefiles, Xcode, Visual Studio, KDevelop or more).  As an
alternative you can download a package with pre-built executables
as described on the "Install"_Install.html doc page.

If you have problems building LAMMPS, it is often due to software
issues on your local machine.  If you can, find a local expert to
help.  If you're still stuck, send an email to the "LAMMPS mail
list"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html.
