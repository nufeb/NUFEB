compute angle command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID angle :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
angle = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all angle :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that extracts the angle energy calculated by each
of the angle sub-styles used in the  "angle_style
hybrid" angle_hybrid.html command.  These values are made accessible
for output or further processing by other commands.  The group
specified for this command is ignored.

This compute is useful when using "angle_style
hybrid"_angle_hybrid.html if you want to know the portion of the total
energy contributed by one or more of the hybrid sub-styles.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector of length N where N is the
number of sub_styles defined by the "angle_style
hybrid"_angle_style.html command, which can be accessed by indices
1-N.  These values can be used by any command that uses global scalar
or vector values from a compute as input.  See the "Howto
output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector values are "extensive" and will be in energy
"units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"compute pe"_compute_pe.html, "compute pair"_compute_pair.html

[Default:] none
