Optional packages :h2

This section gives an overview of the optional packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality.  Packages are groups of files that enable a
specific set of features.  For example, force fields for molecular
systems or rigid-body constraints are in packages.  You can see the
list of all packages and "make" commands to manage them by typing
"make package" from within the src directory of the LAMMPS
distribution.  The "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page gives
general info on how to install and un-install packages as part of the
LAMMPS build process.
