[Description:]

These commands perform time integration on Nose-Hoover style
non-Hamiltonian equations of motion for nuclei and electrons in the
group for the "electron force field"_pair_eff.html model.  The fixes
are designed to generate positions and velocities sampled from the
canonical (nvt), isothermal-isobaric (npt), and isenthalpic (nph)
ensembles.  This is achieved by adding some dynamic variables which
are coupled to the particle velocities (thermostatting) and simulation
domain dimensions (barostatting).  In addition to basic thermostatting
and barostatting, these fixes can also create a chain of thermostats
coupled to the particle thermostat, and another chain of thermostats
coupled to the barostat variables. The barostat can be coupled to the
overall box volume, or to individual dimensions, including the {xy},
{xz} and {yz} tilt dimensions. The external pressure of the barostat
can be specified as either a scalar pressure (isobaric ensemble) or as
components of a symmetric stress tensor (constant stress ensemble).
When used correctly, the time-averaged temperature and stress tensor
of the particles will match the target values specified by
Tstart/Tstop and Pstart/Pstop.

The operation of these fixes is exactly like that described by the
"fix nvt, npt, and nph"_fix_nh.html commands, except that the radius
and radial velocity of electrons are also updated.  Likewise the
temperature and pressure calculated by the fix, using the computes it
creates (as discussed in the "fix nvt, npt, and nph"_fix_nh.html
doc page), are performed with computes that include the eFF contribution
to the temperature or kinetic energy from the electron radial velocity.

NOTE: there are two different pressures that can be reported for eFF
when defining the pair_style (see "pair eff/cut"_pair_eff.html to
understand these settings), one (default) that considers electrons do
not contribute radial virial components (i.e. electrons treated as
incompressible 'rigid' spheres) and one that does.  The radial
electronic contributions to the virials are only tallied if the
flexible pressure option is set, and this will affect both global and
per-atom quantities.  In principle, the true pressure of a system is
somewhere in between the rigid and the flexible eFF pressures, but,
for most cases, the difference between these two pressures will not be
significant over long-term averaged runs (i.e. even though the energy
partitioning changes, the total energy remains similar).

NOTE: currently, there is no available option for the user to set or
create temperature distributions that include the radial electronic
degrees of freedom with the "velocity"_velocity.html command, so the
the user must allow for these degrees of freedom to equilibrate
(i.e. equi-partitioning of energy) through time integration.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

See the doc page for the "fix nvt, npt, and nph"_fix_nh.html commands
for details.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-EFF package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

Other restriction discussed on the doc page for the "fix nvt, npt, and
nph"_fix_nh.html commands also apply.

NOTE: The temperature for systems (regions or groups) with only
electrons and no nuclei is 0.0 (i.e. not defined) in the current
temperature calculations, a practical example would be a uniform
electron gas or a very hot plasma, where electrons remain delocalized
from the nuclei.  This is because, even though electron virials are
included in the temperature calculation, these are averaged over the
nuclear degrees of freedom only.  In such cases a corrective term must
be added to the pressure to get the correct kinetic contribution.
