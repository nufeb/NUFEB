What does a LAMMPS version mean :h3

The LAMMPS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 May
2014. LAMMPS is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it in the next {patch} release, which are
typically made every couple of weeks.  Info on patch releases are on
"this website page"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html. Every few
months, the latest patch release is subjected to more thorough testing
and labeled as a {stable} version.

Each version of LAMMPS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to
and including its version date.

The version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you
run LAMMPS. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the LAMMPS
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.  And it is on the
first page of the "manual"_Manual.html.

If you browse the HTML doc pages on the LAMMPS WWW site, they always
describe the most current patch release of LAMMPS. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have, which may be older. :l,ule
