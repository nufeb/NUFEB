compute smd/vol command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/vol :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/vol = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/vol :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that provides the per-particle volume and the sum
of the per-particle volumes of the group for which the fix is defined.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector values will be given in "units"_units.html of
volume.

Additionally, the compute returns a scalar, which is the sum of the
per-particle volumes of the group for which the fix is defined.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
