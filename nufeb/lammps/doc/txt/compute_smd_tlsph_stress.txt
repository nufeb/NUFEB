compute smd/tlsph/stress command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/tlsph/stress :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/tlsph/stress = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/tlsph/stress :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that outputs the Cauchy stress tensor for
particles interacting via the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector of vectors (tensors),
which can be accessed by any command that uses per-particle values
from a compute as input. See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc
page for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The values will be given in "units"_units.html of pressure.

The per-particle vector has 7 entries. The first six entries
correspond to the xx, yy, zz, xy, xz and yz components of the
symmetric Cauchy stress tensor. The seventh entry is the second
invariant of the stress tensor, i.e., the von Mises equivalent stress.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This quantity will be computed only for particles which interact with
the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.
