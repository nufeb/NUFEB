fix smd/wall_surface command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/wall_surface arg type mol-ID :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
smd/wall_surface = style name of this fix command :l
arg = {file} :l
   {file} = file name of a triangular mesh in stl format :pre
type = particle type to be given to the new particles created by this fix :l
mol-ID = molecule-ID to be given to the new particles created by this fix (must be >= 65535) :l,ule

[Examples:]

fix stl_surf all smd/wall_surface tool.stl 2 65535 :pre

[Description:]

This fix creates reads a triangulated surface from a file in .STL
format.  For each triangle, a new particle is created which stores the
barycenter of the triangle and the vertex positions.  The radius of
the new particle is that of the minimum circle which encompasses the
triangle vertices.

The triangulated surface can be used as a complex rigid wall via the
"smd/tri_surface"_pair_smd_triangulated_surface.html pair style.  It
is possible to move the triangulated surface via the
"smd/move_tri_surf"_fix_smd_move_triangulated_surface.html fix style.

Immediately after a .STL file has been read, the simulation needs to
be run for 0 timesteps in order to properly register the new particles
in the system. See the "funnel_flow" example in the USER-SMD examples
directory.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth Mach
Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor
minimization. This fix has no outputs.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

The molecule ID given to the particles created by this fix have to be
equal to or larger than 65535.

Within each .STL file, only a single triangulated object must be
present, even though the STL format allows for the possibility of
multiple objects in one file.
