compute smd/ulsph/strain command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/ulsph/strain :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/ulsph/strain = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/ulsph/strain :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that outputs the logarithmic strain tensor.  for
particles interacting via the updated Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle tensor, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector has 6 entries, corresponding to the xx, yy,
zz, xy, xz, yz components of the symmetric strain rate tensor.

The per-particle tensor values will be given dimensionless, see
"units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info. This compute can
only be used for particles which interact with the updated Lagrangian
SPH pair style.
