fix nve/eff command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/eff :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
nve/eff = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all nve/eff :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE integration to update position and velocity for
nuclei and electrons in the group for the "electron force
field"_pair_eff.html model.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a
system trajectory consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.

The operation of this fix is exactly like that described by the "fix
nve"_fix_nve.html command, except that the radius and radial velocity
of electrons are also updated.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of

minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-EFF package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
