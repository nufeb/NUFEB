compute dpd command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID dpd :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
dpd = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all dpd :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that accumulates the total internal conductive
energy (U_cond), the total internal mechanical energy (U_mech), the
total chemical energy (U_chem) and the {harmonic} average of the internal
temperature (dpdTheta) for the entire system of particles.  See the
"compute dpd/atom"_compute_dpd_atom.html command if you want
per-particle internal energies and internal temperatures.

The system internal properties are computed according to the following
relations:

:c,image(Eqs/compute_dpd.jpg)

where N is the number of particles in the system

:line

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector of length 5 (U_cond, U_mech,
U_chem, dpdTheta, N_particles), which can be accessed by indices 1-5.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The vector values will be in energy and temperature "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This command is part of the USER-DPD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This command also requires use of the "atom_style dpd"_atom_style.html
command.

[Related commands:]

"compute dpd/atom"_compute_dpd_atom.html,
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html

[Default:] none
