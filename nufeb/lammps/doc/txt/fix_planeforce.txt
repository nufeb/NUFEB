fix planeforce command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID planeforce x y z :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
planeforce = style name of this fix command
x y z = 3-vector that is normal to the plane :ul

[Examples:]

fix hold boundary planeforce 1.0 0.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Adjust the forces on each atom in the group so that only the
components of force in the plane specified by the normal vector
(x,y,z) remain.  This is done by subtracting out the component of
force perpendicular to the plane.

If the initial velocity of the atom is 0.0 (or in the plane), then it
should continue to move in the plane thereafter.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.

[Restrictions:] none
