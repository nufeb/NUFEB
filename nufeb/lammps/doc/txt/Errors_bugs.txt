Reporting bugs :h3

If you are confident that you have found a bug in LAMMPS, follow these
steps.

Check the "New features and bug
fixes"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html section of the "LAMMPS WWW
site"_lws to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed or the
"Unfixed bug"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/unbug.html to see if a fix is
pending.

Check the "mailing list"_http://lammps.sandia.gov/mail.html to see if
it has been discussed before.

If not, send an email to the mailing list describing the problem with
any ideas you have as to what is causing it or where in the code the
problem might be.  The developers will ask for more info if needed,
such as an input script or data files.

The most useful thing you can do to help us fix the bug is to isolate
the problem.  Run it on the smallest number of atoms and fewest number
of processors and with the simplest input script that reproduces the
bug and try to identify what command or combination of commands is
causing the problem.
