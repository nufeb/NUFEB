The following folks deserve special recognition.  Many of the packages
they have written are unique for an MD code and LAMMPS would not be as
general-purpose as it is without their expertise and efforts.

Metin Aktulga (MSU), USER-REAXC package for C version of ReaxFF
Mike Brown (Intel), GPU and USER-INTEL packages
Colin Denniston (U Western Ontario), USER-LB package
Georg Ganzenmuller (EMI), USER-SMD and USER-SPH packages
Andres Jaramillo-Botero (Caltech), USER-EFF package for electron force field
Reese Jones (Sandia) and colleagues, USER-ATC package for atom/continuum coupling
Christoph Kloss (DCS Computing), LIGGGHTS code for granular materials, built on top of LAMMPS
Rudra Mukherjee (JPL), POEMS package for articulated rigid body motion
Trung Ngyuen (Northwestern U), GPU and RIGID and BODY packages
Mike Parks (Sandia), PERI package for Peridynamics
Roy Pollock (LLNL), Ewald and PPPM solvers
Christian Trott (Sandia), USER-CUDA and KOKKOS packages
Ilya Valuev (JIHT), USER-AWPMD package for wave packet MD
Greg Wagner (Northwestern U), MEAM package for MEAM potential :ul
