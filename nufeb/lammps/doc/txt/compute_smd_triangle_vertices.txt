compute smd/triangle/vertices command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/triangle/vertices :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/triangle/vertices = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/triangle/mesh/vertices :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that returns the coordinates of the vertices
corresponding to the triangle-elements of a mesh created by the "fix
smd/wall_surface"_fix_smd_wall_surface.html.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute returns a per-particle vector of vectors, which can be
accessed by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute
as input. See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an
overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector has nine entries, (x1/y1/z1), (x2/y2/z2), and
(x3/y3/z3) corresponding to the first, second, and third vertex of
each triangle.

It is only meaningful to use this compute for a group of particles
which is created via the "fix smd/wall_surface"_fix_smd_wall_surface.html command.

The output of this compute can be used with the dump2vtk_tris tool to
generate a VTK representation of the smd/wall_surface mesh for
visualization purposes.

The values will be given in "units"_units.html of distance.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Default:] none
