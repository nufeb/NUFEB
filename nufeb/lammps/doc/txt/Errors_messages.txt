Error messages :h3

This is an alphabetic list of the ERROR messages LAMMPS prints out and
the reason why.  If the explanation here is not sufficient, the
documentation for the offending command may help.  Error messages also
list the source file and line number where the error was generated.
For example, a message like this:

ERROR: Illegal velocity command (velocity.cpp:78) :pre

means that line #78 in the file src/velocity.cpp generated the error.
Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.

Note that error messages from "user-contributed
packages"_Packages_user.html are not listed here.  If such an error
occurs and is not self-explanatory, you'll need to look in the source
code or contact the author of the package.

:dlb

{1-3 bond count is inconsistent} :dt

neighbors for each atom.  This likely means something is wrong with
the bond topologies you have defined. :dd

An inconsistency was detected when computing the number of 1-4
neighbors for each atom.  This likely means something is wrong with
the bond topologies you have defined. :dd

{Out of range atoms - cannot compute MSM} :dt

One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a MSM grid point
that is not owned by a processor.  This is likely for one of two
reasons, both of them bad.  First, it may mean that an atom near the
boundary of a processor's sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the
"neighbor skin distance"_neighbor.html without neighbor lists being
rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new processors.  This also means
you may be missing pairwise interactions that need to be computed.
The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria via the
"neigh_modify"_neigh_modify.html command.  The safest settings are
"delay 0 every 1 check yes".  Second, it may mean that an atom has
moved far outside a processor's sub-domain or even the entire

overlapping atoms, too large a timestep, etc. :dd

{Rigid body atoms %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld} :dt

This means that an atom cannot find the atom that owns the rigid body
it is part of, or vice versa.  The solution is to use the communicate
cutoff command to insure ghost atoms are acquired from far enough away
to encompass the max distance printed when the fix rigid/small command
was invoked. :dd
