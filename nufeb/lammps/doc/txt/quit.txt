quit command :h3

[Syntax:]

quit status :pre

status = numerical exit status (optional)

[Examples:]

quit
if "$n > 10000" then "quit 1" :pre

[Description:]

This command causes LAMMPS to exit, after shutting down all output
cleanly.

It can be used as a debug statement in an input script, to terminate
the script at some intermediate point.

It can also be used as an invoked command inside the "then" or "else"
portion of an "if"_if.html command.

The optional status argument is an integer which signals the return
status to a program calling LAMMPS.  A return status of 0 usually
indicates success.  A status != 0 is failure, where the specified
value can be used to distinguish the kind of error, e.g. where in the
input script the quit was invoked.  If not specified, a status of 0 is
returned.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"if"_if.html

[Default:] none
