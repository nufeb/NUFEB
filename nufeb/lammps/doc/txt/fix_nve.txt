fix nve command :h3
fix nve/intel command :h3
fix nve/kk command :h3
fix nve/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
nve = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all nve :pre

[Description:]

Perform constant NVE integration to update position and velocity for
atoms in the group each timestep.  V is volume; E is energy.  This
creates a system trajectory consistent with the microcanonical
ensemble.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
