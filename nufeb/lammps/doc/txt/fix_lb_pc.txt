fix lb/pc command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID lb/pc :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in the "fix"_fix.html command
lb/pc = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all lb/pc :pre

[Description:]

Update the positions and velocities of the individual particles
described by {group-ID}, experiencing velocity-dependent hydrodynamic
forces, using the integration algorithm described in "Mackay et
al."_#Mackay1.  This integration algorithm should only be used if a
user-specified value for the force-coupling constant used in "fix
lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html has been set; do not use this integration
algorithm if the force coupling constant has been set by default.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-LB package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html command, and must come after this
command.

[Related commands:]

"fix lb/fluid"_fix_lb_fluid.html "fix
lb/rigid/pc/sphere"_fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere.html

[Default:] None.
