pair_style body/rounded/polygon command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon c_n c_t mu delta_ua cutoff :pre

c_n = normal damping coefficient
c_t = tangential damping coefficient
mu = normal friction coefficient during gross sliding
delta_ua = multiple contact scaling factor
cutoff = global separation cutoff for interactions (distance units), see below for definition :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style body/rounded/polygon 20.0 5.0 0.0 1.0 0.5
pair_coeff * * 100.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {body/rounded/polygon} is for use with 2d models of body
particles of style {rounded/polygon}.  It calculates pairwise
body/body interactions which can include body particles modeled as
1-vertex circular disks with a specified diameter.  See the "Howto
body"_Howto_body.html doc page for more details on using body
rounded/polygon particles.

This pairwise interaction between rounded polygons is described in
"Fraige"_#pair-Fraige, where a polygon does not have sharp corners,
but is rounded at its vertices by circles centered on each vertex with
a specified diameter.  The edges of the polygon are defined between
pairs of adjacent vertices.  The circle diameter for each polygon is
specified in the data file read by the "read data"_read_data.html
command.  This is a 2d discrete element model (DEM) which allows for
multiple contact points.

Note that when two particles interact, the effective surface of each
polygon particle is displaced outward from each of its vertices and
edges by half its circle diameter (as in the diagram below of a gray
and yellow square particle).  The interaction forces and energies
between two particles are defined with respect to the separation of
their respective rounded surfaces, not by the separation of the
vertices and edges themselves.

This means that the specified cutoff in the pair_style command is the
cutoff distance, r_c, for the surface separation, \delta_n (see figure
below).  This is the distance at which two particles no longer
interact.  If r_c is specified as 0.0, then it is a contact-only
interaction.  I.e. the two particles must overlap in order to exert a
repulsive force on each other.  If r_c > 0.0, then the force between
two particles will be attractive for surface separations from 0 to
r_c, and repulsive once the particles overlap.

Note that unlike for other pair styles, the specified cutoff is not
the distance between the centers of two particles at which they stop
interacting.  This center-to-center distance depends on the shape and
size of the two particles and their relative orientation.  LAMMPS
takes that into account when computing the surface separation distance
and applying the r_c cutoff.

The forces between vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, and edge-edge overlaps
are given by:

Note that F_n and F_t are functions of the surface separation \delta_n
= d - (R_i + R_j).  In this model, when (R_i + R_j) < d < (R_i + R_j)
+ r_c, that is, 0 < \delta_n < r_c, the cohesive region of the two
surfaces overlap and the two surfaces are attractive to each other.

In "Fraige"_#pair-Fraige, the tangential friction force between two
particles that are in contact is modeled differently prior to gross
sliding (i.e. static friction) and during gross-sliding (kinetic
friction).  The latter takes place when the tangential deformation
exceeds the Coulomb frictional limit.  In the current implementation,
however, we do not take into account frictional history, i.e. we do
not keep track of how many time steps the two particles have been in
contact nor calculate the tangential deformation.  Instead, we assume
that gross sliding takes place as soon as two particles are in
contact.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atom types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples above,
or in the data file read by the "read_data"_read_data.html command:

k_n (energy/distance^2 units)
k_na (energy/distance^2 units) :ul

Effectively, k_n and k_na are the slopes of the red lines in the plot
above for force versus surface separation, for \delta_n < 0 and 0 <
\delta_n < r_c respectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
mix, shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style does not write its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Thus, you need to re-specify the pair_style and
pair_coeff commands in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

These pair styles are part of the BODY package.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This pair style requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be "on"
for pair interactions.
