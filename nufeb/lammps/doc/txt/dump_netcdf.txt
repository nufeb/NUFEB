dump netcdf command :h3
dump netcdf/mpiio command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID netcdf N file args
dump ID group-ID netcdf/mpiio N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be imaged :l
{netcdf} or {netcdf/mpiio}  = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page) :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
file = name of file to write dump info to :l
args = list of atom attributes, same as for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :l,ule

[Examples:]

dump 1 all netcdf 100 traj.nc type x y z vx vy vz
dump_modify 1 append yes at -1 thermo yes
dump 1 all netcdf/mpiio 1000 traj.nc id type x y z
dump 1 all netcdf 1000 traj.*.nc id type x y z :pre

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom coordinates every N timesteps in Amber-style
NetCDF file format.  NetCDF files are binary, portable and
self-describing.  This dump style will write only one file on the root
node.  The dump style {netcdf} uses the "standard NetCDF
library"_netcdf-home.  All data is collected on one processor and then
written to the dump file.  Dump style {netcdf/mpiio} uses the
"parallel NetCDF library"_pnetcdf-home and MPI-IO to write to the dump
file in parallel; it has better performance on a larger number of
processors.  Note that style {netcdf} outputs all atoms sorted by atom
tag while style {netcdf/mpiio} outputs atoms in order of their MPI
rank.

NetCDF files can be directly visualized via the following tools:

Ovito (http://www.ovito.org/). Ovito supports the AMBER convention and
all extensions of this dump style. :ule,b

VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). :l

AtomEye (http://www.libatoms.org/). The libAtoms version of AtomEye
contains a NetCDF reader that is not present in the standard
distribution of AtomEye. :l,ule

In addition to per-atom data, "thermo"_thermo.html data can be included in the
dump file. The data included in the dump file is identical to the data specified
by "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html.

[Restrictions:]

The {netcdf} and {netcdf/mpiio} dump styles are part of the
USER-NETCDF package.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with
that package. See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for
more info.
