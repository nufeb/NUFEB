Two example input scripts are given, including shocked alpha quartz
and shocked liquid methane. The input script first equilibrate an
initial state with the quantum thermal bath at the target temperature
and then apply the qbmsst to simulate shock compression with quantum
nuclear correction.  The following two figures plot related quantities
for shocked alpha quartz.

example input script. Thermodynamic quantities stay continuous before
and after the restart.

[Description:]

This command performs the Quantum-Bath coupled Multi-Scale Shock
Technique (QBMSST) integration. See "(Qi)"_#Qi for a detailed
description of this method.  The QBMSST provides description of the
thermodynamics and kinetics of shock processes while incorporating
quantum nuclear effects.  The {shockvel} setting determines the steady
shock velocity that will be simulated along direction {dir}.

Quantum nuclear effects "(fix qtb)"_fix_qtb.html can be crucial
especially when the temperature of the initial state is below the
classical limit or there is a great change in the zero point energies
between the initial and final states. Theoretical post processing
quantum corrections of shock compressed water and methane have been
reported as much as 30% of the temperatures "(Goldman)"_#Goldman1.  A
self-consistent method that couples the shock to a quantum thermal
bath described by a colored noise Langevin thermostat has been
developed by Qi et al "(Qi)"_#Qi and applied to shocked methane.  The
onset of chemistry is reported to be at a pressure on the shock
Hugoniot that is 40% lower than observed with classical molecular
dynamics.

It is highly recommended that the system be already in an equilibrium
state with a quantum thermal bath at temperature of {T_init}.  The fix
command "fix qtb"_fix_qtb.html at constant temperature {T_init} could
be used before applying this command to introduce self-consistent
quantum nuclear effects into the initial state.

The parameters {q}, {mu}, {e0}, {p0}, {v0} and {tscale} are described
in the command "fix msst"_fix_msst.html. The values of {e0}, {p0}, or
{v0} will be calculated on the first step if not specified.  The
parameter of {damp}, {f_max}, and {N_f} are described in the command
"fix qtb"_fix_qtb.html.

The fix qbmsst command couples the shock system to a quantum thermal
bath with a rate that is proportional to the change of the total
energy of the shock system, <i>etot</i> - <i>etot</i><sub>0</sub>.
Here <i>etot</i> consists of both the system energy and a thermal
term, see "(Qi)"_#Qi, and <i>etot</i><sub>0</sub> = {e0} is the
initial total energy.

The {eta} (<i>&eta;</i>) parameter is a unitless coupling constant
between the shock system and the quantum thermal bath. A small {eta}
value cannot adjust the quantum temperature fast enough during the
temperature ramping period of shock compression while large {eta}
leads to big temperature oscillation. A value of {eta} between 0.3 and
1 is usually appropriate for simulating most systems under shock
compression. We observe that different values of {eta} lead to almost
the same final thermodynamic state behind the shock, as expected.

The quantum temperature is updated every {beta} (<i>&beta;</i>) steps
with an integration time interval {beta} times longer than the
simulation time step. In that case, <i>etot</i> is taken as its
average over the past {beta} steps. The temperature of the quantum
thermal bath <i>T</i><sup>qm</sup> changes dynamically according to
the following equation where &Delta;<i>t</i> is the MD time step and
<i>&gamma;</i> is the friction constant which is equal to the inverse
of the {damp} parameter.

<center><font size="4"> <i>dT</i><sup>qm</sup>/<i>dt =
&gamma;&eta;</i>&sum;<i><sup>&beta;</sup><sub>l =
1</sub></i>[<i>etot</i>(<i>t-l</i>&Delta;<i>t</i>)-<i>etot</i><sub>0</sub>]/<i>3&beta;Nk</i><sub>B</sub>
</font></center>

The parameter {T_init} is the initial temperature of the quantum
thermal bath and the system before shock loading.

For all pressure styles, the simulation box stays orthorhombic in
shape. Parrinello-Rahman boundary conditions (tilted box) are
supported by LAMMPS, but are not implemented for QBMSST.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Because the state of the random number generator is not written to
"binary restart files"_restart.html, this fix cannot be restarted
"exactly" in an uninterrupted fashion. However, in a statistical
sense, a restarted simulation should produce similar behaviors of the
system as if it is not interrupted.  To achieve such a restart, one
should write explicitly the same value for {q}, {mu}, {damp}, {f_max},
{N_f}, {eta}, and {beta} and set {tscale} = 0 if the system is
compressed during the first run.

The progress of the QBMSST can be monitored by printing the global
scalar and global vector quantities computed by the fix.  The global
vector contains five values in this order:

\[{dhugoniot}, {drayleigh}, {lagrangian_speed}, {lagrangian_position},
{quantum_temperature}\]

{dhugoniot} is the departure from the Hugoniot (temperature units).
{drayleigh} is the departure from the Rayleigh line (pressure units).
{lagrangian_speed} is the laboratory-frame Lagrangian speed (particle velocity) of the computational cell (velocity units).
{lagrangian_position} is the computational cell position in the reference frame moving at the shock speed. This is the distance of the computational cell behind the shock front.
{quantum_temperature} is the temperature of the quantum thermal bath <i>T</i><sup>qm</sup>. :ol

To print these quantities to the log file with descriptive column
headers, the following LAMMPS commands are suggested. Here the
"fix_modify"_fix_modify.html energy command is also enabled to allow
the thermo keyword {etotal} to print the quantity <i>etot</i>.  See
also the "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command.

thermo_style    custom  step temp ke pe lz pzz etotal v_dhug v_dray v_lgr_vel v_lgr_pos v_T_qm f_fix_id :pre

The global scalar under the entry f_fix_id is the quantity of thermo
energy as an extra part of <i>etot</i>. This global scalar and the
vector of 5 quantities can be accessed by various "output
commands"_Howto_output.html. It is worth noting that the temp keyword
under the "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command print the
instantaneous classical temperature <i>T</i><sup>cl</sup> as described
in the command "fix qtb"_fix_qtb.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix style is part of the USER-QTB package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

All cell dimensions must be periodic. This fix can not be used with a
triclinic cell.  The QBMSST fix has been tested only for the group-ID
all.
