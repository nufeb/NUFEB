[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates properties of individual bond
interactions.  The number of datums generated, aggregated across all
processors, equals the number of bonds in the system, modified by the
group parameter as explained below.

All these properties are computed for the pair of atoms in a bond,
whether the 2 atoms represent a simple diatomic molecule, or are part
of some larger molecule.

The value {dist} is the current length of the bond.

The value {engpot} is the potential energy for the bond,
based on the current separation of the pair of atoms in the bond.

The value {force} is the magnitude of the force acting between the
pair of atoms in the bond.

The values {fx}, {fy}, and {fz} are the xyz components of
{force} between the pair of atoms in the bond.

The remaining properties are all computed for motion of the two atoms
relative to the center of mass (COM) velocity of the 2 atoms in the
bond.

The value {engvib} is the vibrational kinetic energy of the two atoms
in the bond, which is simply 1/2 m1 v1^2 + 1/2 m2 v2^2, where v1 and
v2 are the magnitude of the velocity of the 2 atoms along the bond
direction, after the COM velocity has been subtracted from each.

The value {engrot} is the rotational kinetic energy of the two atoms
in the bond, which is simply 1/2 m1 v1^2 + 1/2 m2 v2^2, where v1 and
v2 are the magnitude of the velocity of the 2 atoms perpendicular to
the bond direction, after the COM velocity has been subtracted from
each.

The value {engtrans} is the translational kinetic energy associated
with the motion of the COM of the system itself, namely 1/2 (m1+m2)
Vcm^2 where Vcm = magnitude of the velocity of the COM.

Note that these 3 kinetic energy terms are simply a partitioning of
the summed kinetic energy of the 2 atoms themselves.  I.e. total KE =
1/2 m1 v1^2 + 1/2 m2 v2^2 = engvib + engrot + engtrans, where v1,v2
are the magnitude of the velocities of the 2 atoms, without any
adjustment for the COM velocity.

The value {omega} is the magnitude of the angular velocity of the
two atoms around their COM position.

The value {velvib} is the magnitude of the relative velocity of the
two atoms in the bond towards each other.  A negative value means the
2 atoms are moving toward each other; a positive value means they are
moving apart.

The value {v_name} can be used together with the {set} keyword to
compute a user-specified function of the bond distance.  The {name}
specified for the {v_name} value is the name of an "equal-style
variable"_variable.html which should evaluate a formula based on a
variable which will store the bond distance.  This other variable must
be an "internal-style variable"_variable.html defined in the input
script; its initial numeric value can be anything.  It must be an
internal-style variable, because this command resets its value
directly.  The {set} keyword is used to identify the name of this
other variable associated with theta.

As an example, these commands can be added to the bench/in.rhodo
script to compute the distance^2 of every bond in the system and
output the statistics in various ways:

variable d internal 0.0
variable dsq equal v_d*v_d :pre

compute 1 all property/local batom1 batom2 btype
compute 2 all bond/local engpot dist v_dsq set dist d
dump 1 all local 100 tmp.dump c_1[*] c_2[*] :pre

compute 3 all reduce ave c_2[*]
thermo_style custom step temp press c_3[*] :pre

fix 10 all ave/histo 10 10 100 0 6 20 c_2[3] mode vector file tmp.histo :pre

The "dump local"_dump.html command will output the energy, distance,
distance^2 for every bond in the system.  The
"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command will print the average of
those quantities via the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html command
with thermo output.  And the "fix ave/histo"_fix_ave_histo.html
command will histogram the distance^2 values and write them to a file.

:line

The local data stored by this command is generated by looping over all
the atoms owned on a processor and their bonds.  A bond will only be
included if both atoms in the bond are in the specified compute group.
Any bonds that have been broken (see the "bond_style"_bond_style.html
command) by setting their bond type to 0 are not included.  Bonds that
have been turned off (see the "fix shake"_fix_shake.html or
"delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html commands) by setting their bond type
negative are written into the file, but their energy will be 0.0.

Note that as atoms migrate from processor to processor, there will be
no consistent ordering of the entries within the local vector or array
from one timestep to the next.  The only consistency that is
guaranteed is that the ordering on a particular timestep will be the
same for local vectors or arrays generated by other compute commands.
For example, bond output from the "compute
property/local"_compute_property_local.html command can be combined
with data from this command and output by the "dump local"_dump.html
command in a consistent way.

Here is an example of how to do this:

compute 1 all property/local btype batom1 batom2
compute 2 all bond/local dist engpot
dump 1 all local 1000 tmp.dump index c_1\[*\] c_2\[*\] :pre

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a local vector or local array depending on the
number of values.  The length of the vector or number of rows in the
array is the number of bonds.  If a single value is specified, a local
vector is produced.  If two or more values are specified, a local
array is produced where the number of columns = the number of values.
The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses local
values from a compute as input.  See the "Howto
output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The output for {dist} will be in distance "units"_units.html. The
output for {velvib} will be in velocity "units"_units.html. The output
for {omega} will be in velocity/distance "units"_units.html. The
output for {engtrans}, {engvib}, {engrot}, and {engpot} will be in
energy "units"_units.html. The output for {force} will be in force
"units"_units.html.
