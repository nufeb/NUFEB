dihedral_style nharmonic command :h3
dihedral_style nharmonic/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style nharmonic :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style nharmonic
dihedral_coeff * 3 10.0 20.0 30.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {nharmonic} dihedral style uses the potential:

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_nharmonic.jpg)

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

n (integer >=1)
A1 (energy)
A2 (energy)
...
An (energy) :ul

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
USER_MISC package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc
page for more info.
