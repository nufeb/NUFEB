fix smd/adjust_dt command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID smd/adjust_dt arg :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
smd/adjust_dt = style name of this fix command :l
arg = {s_fact} :l
  {s_fact} = safety factor  :pre

:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all smd/adjust_dt 0.1 :pre

[Description:]

The fix calculates a new stable time increment for use with the SMD
time integrators.

The stable time increment is based on multiple conditions. For the SPH
pair styles, a CFL criterion (Courant, Friedrichs & Lewy, 1928) is
evaluated, which determines the speed of sound cannot propagate
further than a typical spacing between particles within a single time
step to ensure no information is lost. For the contact pair styles, a
linear analysis of the pair potential determines a stable maximum time
step.

This fix inquires the minimum stable time increment across all
particles contained in the group for which this fix is defined. An
additional safety factor {s_fact} is applied to the time increment.

Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Currently, no part of USER-SMD supports restarting nor minimization.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
