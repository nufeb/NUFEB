fix nve/spin command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID nve/spin keyword values :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
nve/spin = style name of this fix command :l
keyword = {lattice} :l
  {lattice} value = {moving} or {frozen}
    moving = integrate both spin and atomic degress of freedom
    frozen = integrate spins on a fixed lattice :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 3 all nve/spin lattice moving
fix 1 all nve/spin lattice frozen :pre

[Description:]

Perform a symplectic integration for the spin or spin-lattice system.

The {lattice} keyword defines if the spins are integrated on a lattice
of fixed atoms (lattice = frozen), or if atoms are moving
(lattice = moving).
The first case corresponds to a spin dynamics calculation, and
the second to a spin-lattice calculation.
By default a spin-lattice integration is performed (lattice = moving).

The {nve/spin} fix applies a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to
the equations of motion of the spin lattice system, following the scheme:

:c,image(Eqs/fix_integration_spin_stdecomposition.jpg)

according to the implementation reported in "(Omelyan)"_#Omelyan1.

A sectoring method enables this scheme for parallel calculations.
The implementation of this sectoring algorithm is reported
in "(Tranchida)"_#Tranchida1.

[Restrictions:]

This fix style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the SPIN
package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.

To use the spin algorithm, it is necessary to define a map with
the atom_modify command. Typically, by adding the command:

atom_modify map array :pre

before you create the simulation box. Note that the keyword "hash"
instead of "array" is also valid.

[Related commands:]

[Default:] 

The option default is lattice = moving.
