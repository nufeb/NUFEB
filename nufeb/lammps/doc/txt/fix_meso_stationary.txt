fix meso/stationary command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID meso/stationary :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
meso = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 boundary meso/stationary :pre

[Description:]

Perform time integration to update internal energy and local density,
but not position or velocity for atoms in the group each timestep.
This fix is needed for SPH simulations to correctly time-integrate
fixed boundary particles which constrain a fluid to a given region in
space.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/sph/SPH_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using SPH in
LAMMPS.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Howto_output.html.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.  This fix is not invoked during "energy
minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-SPH package.  It is only enabled if
