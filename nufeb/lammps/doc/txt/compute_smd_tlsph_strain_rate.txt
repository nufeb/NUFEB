compute smd/tlsph/strain/rate command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/tlsph/strain/rate :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/tlsph/strain/rate = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/tlsph/strain/rate :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the rate of the strain tensor for
particles interacting via the Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector of vectors (tensors),
which can be accessed by any command that uses per-particle values
from a compute as input. See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc
page for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The values will be given in "units"_units.html of one over time.

The per-particle vector has 6 entries, corresponding to the xx, yy,
zz, xy, xz, yz components of the symmetric strain rate tensor.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This quantity will be computed only for particles which interact with
Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.
