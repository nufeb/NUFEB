dump atoms/adios  command :h3
dump custom/adios command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID atoms/adios N file.bp :pre
dump ID group-ID custom/adios N file.bp args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be imaged :l
adios = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page) :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
file.bp = name of file/stream to write to :l
args = same options as in "{dump custom}"_dump.html command :l
:ule


[Examples:]

dump adios1 all atom/adios   100 atoms.bp
dump 4a     all custom/adios 100 dump_adios.bp id v_p x y z
dump 2 subgroup custom/adios 100 dump_adios.bp mass type xs ys zs vx vy vz :pre

[Description:]

Dump a snapshot of atom coordinates every N timesteps in the
"ADIOS"_adios based "BP" file format, or using different I/O solutions in ADIOS,
to a stream that can be read on-line by another program.
ADIOS-BP files are binary, portable and self-describing.

[Use from write_dump:]

It is possible to use these dump styles with the
"write_dump"_write_dump.html command.  In this case, the sub-intervals
must not be set at all.  The write_dump command can be used to
create a new file at each individual dump.

dump 4     all atom/adios 100 dump.bp
write_dump all atom/adios singledump.bp :pre

:line

[Restrictions:]

The number of atoms per snapshot CAN change with the adios style.
When using the ADIOS tool 'bpls' to list the content of a .bp file,
bpls will print {__} for the size of the output table indicating that
its size is changing every step.

The {atom/adios} and {custom/adios} dump styles are part of the USER-ADIOS
package.  They are only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.
See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
