fix rhok command :h3

fix ID group-ID rhok nx ny nz K a :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
nx, ny, nz = k-vector of collective density field
K = spring constant of bias potential
a = anchor point of bias potential :ul

[Examples:]

fix bias all rhok 16 0 0 4.0 16.0
fix 1 all npt temp 0.8 0.8 4.0 z 2.2 2.2 8.0
# output of 4 values from fix rhok: U_bias rho_k_RE  rho_k_IM  |rho_k|
thermo_style custom step temp pzz lz f_bias f_bias\[1\] f_bias\[2\] f_bias\[3\] :pre

[Description:]

The fix applies a force to atoms given by the potential

:c,image(Eqs/fix_rhok.jpg)

as described in "(Pedersen)"_#Pedersen.

This field, which biases configurations with long-range order, can be
used to study crystal-liquid interfaces and determine melting
temperatures "(Pedersen)"_#Pedersen.

An example of using the interface pinning method is located in the
{examples/USER/misc/rhok} directory.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Related commands:]

"thermo_style"_thermo_style.html

[Default:] none
