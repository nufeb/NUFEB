write_coeff command :h3

[Syntax:]

write_coeff file :pre

file = name of data file to write out :pre

[Examples:]

write_coeff polymer.coeff :pre

[Description:]

Write a text format file with the currently defined force field
coefficients in a way, that it can be read by LAMMPS with the
"include"_include.html command. In combination with the nocoeff
option of "write_data"_write_data.html this can be used to move
the Coeffs sections from a data file into a separate file.

NOTE: The write_coeff command is not yet fully implemented as
some pair styles do not output their coefficient information.
This means you will need to add/copy this information manually.
