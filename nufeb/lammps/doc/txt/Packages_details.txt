Package details :h3

Here is a brief description of all the standard and user packages in
LAMMPS.  It lists authors (if applicable) and summarizes the package
contents.  It has specific instructions on how to install the package,
including, if necessary, info on how to download or build any extra
library it requires.  It also gives links to documentation, example
scripts, and pictures/movies (if available) that illustrate use of the
package.

The majority of packages can be included in a LAMMPS build with a
single setting (-D PGK_NAME for CMake) or command ("make yes-name" for
make).  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page for more
info.  A few packages may require additional steps; this is indicated
in the descriptions below.  The "Build extras"_Build_extras.html doc
page gives those details.

NOTE: To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
you can examine the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls
src/GRANULAR".  Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom,
pair, bond, angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style name
as contained in the file name.

KIM package :link(PKG-KIM),h4

[Contents:]

This package contains a set of commands that serve as a wrapper on the
"Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (OpenKIM)"_https://openkim.org
repository of interatomic models (IMs)
enabling compatible ones to be used in LAMMPS simulations.
This includes "kim_init and kim_interactions"_kim_commands.html
commands to select, initialize and instantiate the IM, and a
"kim_query"_kim_commands.html command to perform web queries
for material property predictions of OpenKIM IMs.
Support for KIM IMs that conform to the
"KIM Application Programming Interface (API)"_https://openkim.org/kim-api/
is provided by the "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command.

NOTE: The command {pair_style kim} is called by {kim_interactions} and
is not recommended to be directly used in input scripts.

To use this package you must have the KIM API library available on your
system. The KIM API is available for download on the
"OpenKIM website"_https://openkim.org/kim-api/.
When installing LAMMPS from binary, the kim-api package
is a dependency that is automatically downloaded and installed.

Information about the KIM project can be found at its website:
"https://openkim.org"_https://openkim.org.
The KIM project is led by Ellad Tadmor and Ryan Elliott (U Minnesota)
and is funded by the "National Science Foundation"_https://www.nsf.gov/.

[Authors:] Ryan Elliott (U Minnesota) is the main developer for the KIM
API and the {pair_style kim} command. Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U) and
Ellad Tadmor (U Minnesota) contributed to the "kim_commands"_kim_commands.html
interface in close collaboration with Ryan Elliott.

KOKKOS package :link(PKG-KOKKOS),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of atom, pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, fix, compute
styles adapted to compile using the Kokkos library which can convert
them to OpenMP or CUDA code so that they run efficiently on multicore
CPUs, KNLs, or GPUs.  All the styles have a "kk" as a suffix in their
style name.  The "Speed kokkos"_Speed_kokkos.html doc page gives
details of what hardware and software is required on your system, and
how to build and use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run
time via the "-sf kk" or "-suffix kk" "command-line
switches"_Run_options.html.  Also see the "GPU"_#PKG-GPU, "OPT"_#PKG-OPT,
"USER-INTEL"_#PKG-USER-INTEL, and "USER-OMP"_#PKG-USER-OMP packages, which
have styles optimized for CPUs, KNLs, and GPUs.

You must have a C++11 compatible compiler to use this package.
KOKKOS makes extensive use of advanced C++ features, which can
expose compiler bugs, especially when compiling for maximum
performance at high optimization levels. Please see the file
lib/kokkos/README for a list of compilers and their respective
platforms, that are known to work.

[Authors:] The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
and Stan Moore (Sandia), with contributions from other folks as well.
It uses the open-source "Kokkos library"_https://github.com/kokkos
which was developed by Carter Edwards, Christian Trott, and others at
Sandia, and which is included in the LAMMPS distribution in

USER-MOLFILE package :link(PKG-USER-MOLFILE),h4

[Contents:]

A "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command which uses molfile plugins
that are bundled with the "VMD"_vmd-home
molecular visualization and analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump
snapshots in formats compatible with various molecular simulation
tools.

To use this package you must have the desired VMD plugins available on
your system.

Note that this package only provides the interface code, not the
plugins themselves, which will be accessed when requesting a specific
plugin via the "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command.  Plugins can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins to VMD,
support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other
programs that use them) without having to re-compile the application
itself.  More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found
at
"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile.

[Contents:]

Hundreds of pair, fix, compute, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and
kspace styles which are altered to enable threading on many-core CPUs
via OpenMP directives.  All of them have an "omp" in their style name.
The "Speed omp"_Speed_omp.html doc page gives details of what hardware
and compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use
this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf omp"
or "-suffix omp" "command-line switches"_Run_options.html.  Also see
the "KOKKOS"_#PKG-KOKKOS, "OPT"_#PKG-OPT, and "USER-INTEL"_#PKG-USER-INTEL
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

NOTE: To enable multi-threading support the compile flag "-fopenmp"
and the link flag "-fopenmp" (for GNU compilers, you have to look up
the equivalent flags for other compilers) must be used to build LAMMPS.
When using Intel compilers, also the "-restrict" flag is required.
The USER-OMP package can be compiled without enabling OpenMP; then
all code will be compiled as serial and the only improvement over the
regular styles are some data access optimization. These flags should
be added to the CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS lines of your Makefile.machine.
See src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.omp for an example.

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner:

USER-QMMM package :link(PKG-USER-QMMM),h4

[Contents:]

A "fix qmmm"_fix_qmmm.html command which allows LAMMPS to be used in a
QM/MM simulation, currently only in combination with the "Quantum
ESPRESSO"_espresso package.

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

To use this package you must have Quantum ESPRESSO available on your
system.

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

USER-QTB package :link(PKG-USER-QTB),h4

[Contents:]

Two fixes which provide a self-consistent quantum treatment of
vibrational modes in a classical molecular dynamics simulation.  By
coupling the MD simulation to a colored thermostat, it introduces zero
point energy into the system, altering the energy power spectrum and
the heat capacity to account for their quantum nature. This is useful
when modeling systems at temperatures lower than their classical
limits or when temperatures ramp across the classical limits in a
simulation.

USER-SMD package :link(PKG-USER-SMD),h4

[Contents:]

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed Mach dynamics (SMD) for solids, which is a model
related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids (see the
"USER-SPH package"_#PKG-USER-SPH).

This package solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art
stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.  It can specify
hydrostatic interactions independently from material strength models,
i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.  It provides many
material models (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with hardening,
Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS) and allows new material models to be
added.  It implements rigid boundary conditions (walls) which can be
specified as surface geometries from *.STL files.

Dynamics, Ernst Mach Institute, Germany).
