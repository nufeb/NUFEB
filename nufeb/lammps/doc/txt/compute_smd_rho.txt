compute smd/rho command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/rho :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/rho = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/rho :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-particle mass density.
The mass density is the mass of a particle which is constant during
the course of a simulation, divided by its volume, which can change
due to mechanical deformation.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values will be in "units"_units.html of mass over volume.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.
