dihedral_style zero command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style zero {nocoeff} :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style zero
dihedral_style zero nocoeff
dihedral_coeff * :pre

[Description:]

Using a dihedral style of zero means dihedral forces and energies are
not computed, but the geometry of dihedral quadruplets is still
accessible to other commands.

As an example, the "compute
dihedral/local"_compute_dihedral_local.html command can be used to
compute the theta values for the list of quadruplets of dihedral atoms
listed in the data file read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
command.  If no dihedral style is defined, this command cannot be
used.

The optional {nocoeff} flag allows to read data files with a DihedralCoeff
section for any dihedral style. Similarly, any dihedral_coeff commands
will only be checked for the dihedral type number and the rest ignored.

Note that the "dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command must be
used for all dihedral types, though no additional values are
specified.

[Restrictions:] none
