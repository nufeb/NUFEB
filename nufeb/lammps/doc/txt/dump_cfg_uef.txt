dump cfg/uef command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID cfg/uef N file mass type xs ys zs args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump :ulb,l
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms to be dumped :l
N = dump every this many timesteps :l
file = name of file to write dump info to :l
args = same as args for "dump custom"_dump.html :pre

:ule

[Examples:]

dump 1 all cfg/uef 10 dump.*.cfg mass type xs ys zs
dump 2 all cfg/uef 100 dump.*.cfg mass type xs ys zs id c_stress :pre

[Description:]

This command is used to dump atomic coordinates in the
reference frame of the applied flow field when
"fix nvt/uef"_fix_nh_uef.html or
"fix npt/uef"_fix_nh_uef.html or is used. Only the atomic
coordinates and frame-invariant scalar quantities
will be in the flow frame. If velocities are selected
as output, for example, they will not be in the same
reference frame as the atomic positions.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is part of the USER-UEF package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package. See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This command can only be used when "fix nvt/uef"_fix_nh_uef.html
or "fix npt/uef"_fix_nh_uef.html is active.

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html,
"fix nvt/uef"_fix_nh_uef.html

[Default:] none
