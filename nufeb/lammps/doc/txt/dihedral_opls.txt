dihedral_style opls command :h3
dihedral_style opls/intel command :h3
dihedral_style opls/kk command :h3
dihedral_style opls/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style opls :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style opls
dihedral_coeff 1 1.740 -0.157 0.279 0.00   # CT-CT-CT-CT
dihedral_coeff 2 0.000 0.000 0.366 0.000   # CT-CT-CT-HC
dihedral_coeff 3 0.000 0.000 0.318 0.000   # HC-CT-CT-HC :pre

[Description:]

The {opls} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_opls.jpg)

Note that the usual 1/2 factor is not included in the K values.

This dihedral potential is used in the OPLS force field and is
described in "(Watkins)"_#Watkins.

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K1 (energy)
K2 (energy)
K3 (energy)
K4 (energy) :ul

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package.  See the "Build package"_Build_package.html doc page
for more info.
