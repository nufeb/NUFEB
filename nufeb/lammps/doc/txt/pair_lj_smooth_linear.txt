pair_style lj/smooth/linear command :h3
pair_style lj/smooth/linear/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lj/smooth/linear cutoff :pre

cutoff = global cutoff for Lennard-Jones interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lj/smooth/linear 2.5
pair_coeff * * 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.3 3.0 9.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {lj/smooth/linear} computes a truncated and force-shifted LJ
interaction (aka Shifted Force Lennard-Jones) that combines the
standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones function and subtracts a linear term based
on the cutoff distance, so that both, the potential and the force, go
continuously to zero at the cutoff Rc "(Toxvaerd)"_#Toxvaerd:

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional. If not specified, the global
LJ cutoff specified in the pair_style command is used.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance can be mixed. The default mix value is geometric.
See the "pair_modify" command for details.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction, since it goes
to 0.0 at the cutoff by construction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure, since the energy of the pair interaction is smoothed to 0.0
at the cutoff.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.
