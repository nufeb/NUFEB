compute smd/tlsph/num/neighs command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/tlsph/num/neighs :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/tlsph/num/neighs = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/tlsph/num/neighs :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the number of particles inside of
the smoothing kernel radius for particles interacting via the
Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See "this PDF guide"_PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values are dimensionless. See "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This quantity will be computed only for particles which interact with
the Total-Lagrangian pair style.

[Default:] none
