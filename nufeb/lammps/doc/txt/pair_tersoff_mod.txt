[Syntax:]

pair_style tersoff/mod :pre

pair_style tersoff/mod/c :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style tersoff/mod
pair_coeff * * Si.tersoff.mod Si Si :pre

pair_style tersoff/mod/c
pair_coeff * * Si.tersoff.modc Si Si :pre

[Description:]

The {tersoff/mod} and {tersoff/mod/c} styles computes a bond-order type
interatomic potential "(Kumagai)"_#Kumagai based on a 3-body Tersoff
potential "(Tersoff_1)"_#Tersoff_12, "(Tersoff_2)"_#Tersoff_22 with
modified cutoff function and angular-dependent term, giving the energy
E of a system of atoms as

:c,image(Eqs/pair_tersoff_mod.jpg)

where f_R is a two-body term and f_A includes three-body interactions.
The summations in the formula are over all neighbors J and K of atom I
within a cutoff distance = R + D.
The {tersoff/mod/c} style differs from {tersoff/mod} only in the
formulation of the V_ij term, where it contains an additional c0 term.

:c,image(Eqs/pair_tersoff_mod_c.jpg)

The modified cutoff function f_C proposed by "(Murty)"_#Murty and
having a continuous second-order differential is employed. The
angular-dependent term g(theta) was modified to increase the
flexibility of the potential.

The {tersoff/mod} potential is fitted to both the elastic constants
and melting point by employing the modified Tersoff potential function
form in which the angular-dependent term is improved. The model
performs extremely well in describing the crystalline, liquid, and
amorphous phases "(Schelling)"_#Schelling.

Only a single pair_coeff command is used with the {tersoff/mod} style
which specifies a Tersoff/MOD potential file with parameters for all
needed elements.  These are mapped to LAMMPS atom types by specifying
N additional arguments after the filename in the pair_coeff command,
where N is the number of LAMMPS atom types:

filename
N element names = mapping of Tersoff/MOD elements to atom types :ul

As an example, imagine the Si.tersoff_mod file has Tersoff values for Si.
If your LAMMPS simulation has 3 Si atoms types, you would use the following
pair_coeff command:

pair_coeff * * Si.tersoff_mod Si Si Si :pre

The 1st 2 arguments must be * * so as to span all LAMMPS atom types.
The three Si arguments map LAMMPS atom types 1,2,3 to the Si element
in the Tersoff/MOD file. If a mapping value is specified as NULL, the
mapping is not performed.  This can be used when a {tersoff/mod}
potential is used as part of the {hybrid} pair style. The NULL values
are placeholders for atom types that will be used with other
potentials.

Tersoff/MOD file in the {potentials} directory of the LAMMPS
distribution have a ".tersoff.mod" suffix. Potential files for the
{tersoff/mod/c} style have the suffix ".tersoff.modc". Lines that are
not blank or comments (starting with #) define parameters for a triplet
of elements.  The parameters in a single entry correspond to
coefficients in the formulae above:

element 1 (the center atom in a 3-body interaction)
element 2 (the atom bonded to the center atom)
element 3 (the atom influencing the 1-2 bond in a bond-order sense)
beta
alpha
h
eta
beta_ters = 1 (dummy parameter)
lambda2 (1/distance units)
B (energy units)
R (distance units)
D (distance units)
lambda1 (1/distance units)
A (energy units)
n
c1
c2
c3
c4
c5
c0 (energy units, tersoff/mod/c only):ul

The n, eta, lambda2, B, lambda1, and A parameters are only used for
two-body interactions.  The beta, alpha, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, h
parameters are only used for three-body interactions. The R and D
parameters are used for both two-body and three-body interactions.
The c0 term applies to {tersoff/mod/c} only. The non-annotated
parameters are unitless.

The Tersoff/MOD potential file must contain entries for all the elements
listed in the pair_coeff command.  It can also contain entries for
additional elements not being used in a particular simulation; LAMMPS
ignores those entries.

For a single-element simulation, only a single entry is required
(e.g. SiSiSi). As annotated above, the first element in the entry is
the center atom in a three-body interaction and it is bonded to the
2nd atom and the bond is influenced by the 3rd atom.  Thus an entry
for SiSiSi means Si bonded to a Si with another Si atom influencing the bond.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
shift, table, and tail options.

This pair style does not write its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, since it is stored in potential files.  Thus, you
need to re-specify the pair_style and pair_coeff commands in an input
script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

:line

[Restrictions:]

This pair style is part of the MANYBODY package.  It is only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This pair style requires the "newton"_newton.html setting to be "on"
for pair interactions.

The Tersoff/MOD potential files provided with LAMMPS (see the potentials
directory) are parameterized for metal "units"_units.html.  You can
use the Tersoff/MOD potential with any LAMMPS units, but you would need to
create your own Tersoff/MOD potential file with coefficients listed in the
appropriate units if your simulation doesn't use "metal" units.
