pair_style yukawa/colloid command :h3
pair_style yukawa/colloid/gpu command :h3
pair_style yukawa/colloid/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style yukawa/colloid kappa cutoff :pre

kappa = screening length (inverse distance units)
cutoff = global cutoff for colloidal Yukawa interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style yukawa/colloid 2.0 2.5
pair_coeff 1 1 100.0 2.3
pair_coeff * * 100.0 :pre

[Description:]

Style {yukawa/colloid} computes pairwise interactions with the formula

:c,image(Eqs/pair_yukawa_colloid.jpg)

where Ri and Rj are the radii of the two particles and Rc is the
cutoff.

In contrast to "pair_style yukawa"_pair_yukawa.html, this functional
form arises from the Coulombic interaction between two colloid
particles, screened due to the presence of an electrolyte, see the
book by "Safran"_#Safran for a derivation in the context of DLVO
theory.  "Pair_style yukawa"_pair_yukawa.html is a screened Coulombic
potential between two point-charges and uses no such approximation.

This potential applies to nearby particle pairs for which the Derjagin
approximation holds, meaning h << Ri + Rj, where h is the
surface-to-surface separation of the two particles.

When used in combination with "pair_style colloid"_pair_colloid.html,
the two terms become the so-called DLVO potential, which combines
electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands, or by mixing as described below:

A (energy/distance units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The prefactor A is determined from the relationship between surface
charge and surface potential due to the presence of electrolyte.  Note
that the A for this potential style has different units than the A
used in "pair_style yukawa"_pair_yukawa.html.  For low surface
potentials, i.e. less than about 25 mV, A can be written as:

A = 2 * PI * R*eps*eps0 * kappa * psi^2 :pre

where

R = colloid radius (distance units)
eps0 = permittivity of free space (charge^2/energy/distance units)
eps = relative permittivity of fluid medium (dimensionless)
kappa = inverse screening length (1/distance units)
psi = surface potential (energy/charge units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global
yukawa/colloid cutoff is used.

Styles with a {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed on the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc
page.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Run_options.html when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can use the
"suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Speed packages"_Speed_packages.html doc page for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the A coefficient and cutoff
distance for this pair style can be mixed.  A is an energy value mixed
like a LJ epsilon.  The default mix value is {geometric}.  See the
"pair_modify" command for details.

This pair style supports the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift
option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

This pair style writes its information to "binary restart
files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the {pair} keyword of the
"run_style respa"_run_style.html command.  It does not support the
{inner}, {middle}, {outer} keywords.

[Restrictions:]

This style is part of the COLLOID package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

This pair style requires that atoms be finite-size spheres with a
diameter, as defined by the "atom_style sphere"_atom_style.html
command.

Per-particle polydispersity is not yet supported by this pair style;
per-type polydispersity is allowed.  This means all particles of the
same type must have the same diameter.  Each type can have a different
diameter.
