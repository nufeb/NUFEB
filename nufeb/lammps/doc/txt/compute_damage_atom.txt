compute damage/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID damage/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
damage/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all damage/atom :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom damage for each atom
in a group.  This is a quantity relevant for "Peridynamics
models"_pair_peri.html.  See "this document"_PDF/PDLammps_overview.pdf
for an overview of LAMMPS commands for Peridynamics modeling.

The "damage" of a Peridynamics particles is based on the bond breakage
between the particle and its neighbors.  If all the bonds are broken
the particle is considered to be fully damaged.

See the "PDLAMMPS user
guide"_http://www.sandia.gov/~mlparks/papers/PDLAMMPS.pdf for a formal
definition of "damage" and more details about Peridynamics as it is
implemented in LAMMPS.

This command can be used with all the Peridynamic pair styles.

The damage value will be 0.0 for atoms not in the specified compute
group.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values are unitless numbers (damage) >= 0.0.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the PERI package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Build
package"_Build_package.html doc page for more info.

[Default:] none
