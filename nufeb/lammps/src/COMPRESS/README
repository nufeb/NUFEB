This package provides derived dump styles that allow compressed file
I/O via compression libraries. This is similar to what is enabled
through using the -DLAMMPS_GZIP preprocessor flag and a *.gz suffix on
a dump file name when using a non-gz dump style (e.g. custom instead
of custom/gz), but it does not open a pipe to an external executable
that handles the compression. Instead these styles use library calls
to libraries like zlib, and thus have to be compiled using the library
header files and linked to the corresponding library. This provides an
alternative for compressed file I/O on systems where using a pipe can
cause problems, e.g. when using RDMA communication with pinned memory
like clusters with Infiniband or Myrinet.

Currently a few selected dump styles are supported for writing via
this packaging.
