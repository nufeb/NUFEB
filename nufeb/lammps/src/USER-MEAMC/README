This package implements the MEAM/C potential as a LAMMPS pair style.

==============================================================================

This package is a translation of the MEAM package to native C++. See
that package as well as the Fortran code distributed in lib/meam for
the original sources and information.

The original Fortran implementation was created by
  Greg Wagner (while at Sandia, now at Northwestern U).

==============================================================================

Use "make yes-user-meamc" to enable this package when building LAMMPS.

In your LAMMPS input script, specifiy
  pair_style meam/c
to enable the use of this implementation. All parameters, input files and
outputs are exactly identical to these used with pair_style meam.
