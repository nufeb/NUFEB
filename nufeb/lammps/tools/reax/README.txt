=== ReaxFF tools ===
===============================

The programs in this folder can be used to analyze the
output of simulations using the ReaxFF potentials;

reaxc_bond.pl: reads the bonding information in the
                .trj file produced by pair_style reax/c and
                outputs molecule counts for each frame.
