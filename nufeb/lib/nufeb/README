The Makefile.lammps file in this directory is used when building LAMMPS with
its USER-NUFEB package installed. 

The default setting is to link LAMMPS with VTK library

To dump simulation results in HDF format, 
you need to link LAMMPS with the HDF library.

To illustrate, these are example settings from the
Makefile.lammps_hdf5:

nufeb_SYSINC = -std=c++1y -DENABLE_DUMP_GRID -I/usr/local/include/vtk-6.3 -DENABLE_DUMP_BIO_HDF5
nufeb_SYSLIB = -lvtksys-6.3 -lvtkCommonCore-6.3 -lvtkCommonExecutionModel-6.3 -lvtkCommonMisc-6.3 -lvtkCommonMath-6.3 -lvtkCommonSystem-6.3 -lvtkCommonTransforms-6.3 -lvtkIOCore-6.3 -lvtkIOXML-6.3 -lvtkIOXMLParser-6.3 -lvtkIOLegacy-6.3 -lvtkIOParallelXML-6.3 -lvtkCommonDataModel-6.3 -lvtkParallelCore-6.3 -lhdf5
nufeb_SYSPATH = 

vtk_SYSINC refers to the include directory of the installed VTK library, 
-DENABLE_DUMP_GRID is the flag to dump mesh grid information
 -DENABLE_DUMP_BIO_HDF5 is the flag to dump results in HDF format
-I/usr/local/include/vtk-6.3 is the path where the VTK library can be found.
You may also need to specify the path where the HDF library can be found

vtk_SYSLIB refers to the libraries needed to link to from an application
(LAMMPS in this case) to "embed" VTK in the application. VTK consists of
multiple shared libraries which are needed when using the USER-NUFEB package.

vtk_SYSPATH = refers to the path where the VTK library
can be found.  You may not need this setting if the path is already included in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
