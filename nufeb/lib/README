This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
NUFEB/LAMMPS.

Most of these directories contain code for the library; some contain
a Makefile.lammps file that points to where the library is installed
elsewhere on your system.  

In either case, the library itself must be installed and/or built
first, so that the appropriate library files exist for LAMMPS to link
against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries in this directory are the following:


nufeb         hooks to the NUFEB library, used by USER-NUFEB package

vtk           hooks to the VTK library, used by dump custom/vtk command (USER-VTK package)
              from Richard Berger (JKU). Two addtional settings for compiling 
              with vtk6.3 and rocket are added in the directory

cfddem        hooks to the CFDDEM (nufebfoam) library, used by USER-CFDDEM package
