demFoam is the name of this project combining the LAMMPS and openFoam.

LAMMPS is an open source molecular dynamics code that perform DEM simulations.

OpenFOAM is an open source toolbox for CFD simulations.

The structure of the demFoam is like this:

demFoam
|
|----Allwclean.sh
|----Allwmake.sh
|----cases/
|----documentation/
|----interfaceToLammps/
|----lammpsFoam/
|----readme/

Allwclean.sh are Allwmake.sh written to help with the compilation of lammpsFoam, the CFD--DEM solver
in demFoam project. Allwmake.sh will help you install lammpsFoam while Allclean.sh will uninstall
lammpsFoam. Note that the source file of LAMMPS is not included in demFoam. We recommend you use
lammps-1Feb14.

All numerical cases are placed in cases/, with verification cases and validations cases.

Some documents are in documentation/, with a basic user manual (userManual.tex).

interfaceToLammps/ and lammpsFoam/ are folders containing the source code of lammpsFoam. To compile
lammpsFoam, the files of interfaceToLammps/ should be copied to LAMMPS-(some version)/src.
