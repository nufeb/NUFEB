If bound boxes do not change during simulations, then in each simulation do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the boundary box of each OF processor $B^o_1$ to $B^o_n$, broadcast to all processors
\item Find the box of each Lammps processor $B^l_1$ to $B^l_n$, broadcast to all processors
\item On each processor $i$, 
\begin{lstlisting}[fontadjust]
    for j = 1 : n-1
    {
	find intersection $S^{(i)}[j]$ of $B^o_i$ and $B^l_j$
    }
\end{lstlisting}
One can think of $S_{ij}$ as a ``matrix'', with each processor $i$ holding a row corresponding to its own intersection with all others. Each element of $B$ and $S$ are bound box in the format of [$\mathbf{x}_{low}$, $\mathbf{x}_{high}$].  Since $S[j]$ is local to each processor, superscript $(i)$ can be omitted.
\item Create buffers for communication (each buffer corresponding to a overlapping neighbor
\end{enumerate}

At each OpenFOAM time-step (which may consist of a number of Lammps time steps), do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item During foam-to-lammps communication (drag forces), on each processor $i$
\begin{lstlisting}[fontadjust]
    // Np = number of  local particles on processor $i$, $p_1$ to $p_N$
    // loop through all particles
    for k = 1 : Np  {
        // loop through all processors
        for j = 1 : n {
            // I have overlap with processor $j$
            if(S[j] not empty and j != k)   {
	      if ($p_k$ in S[j])  { add $p_k$ to buffer outgoing[j]}
	  }
        }
    }
    send buffer to all processor (i.e., outgoing[j] to processor $j$)
    receive buffer  from all processors, place in incoming[j]
\end{lstlisting}

\item  The most recent foam processor ID (to which the processor belongs to) is a property of the particle (in Lammps data structure), and will be passed to OpenFOAM at each fluid time step (exchange). 
During lammps-to-foam communication (particle information $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}$, tag, etc.), on each processor~$i$:
scan through all particles, send the particle information ($\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}$, tag, etc.) to the processor it belongs to in OpenFOAM.


\item OpenFoam will unpack the particle position and velocity data, and update the particle states (including host cell IDs). If a particle has cross OpenFOAM processor boundary, this will also be handled (by passing the particle to the new processor). 

\end{enumerate}
