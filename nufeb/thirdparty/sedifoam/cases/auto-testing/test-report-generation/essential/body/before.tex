\section{Validation cases}

Several numerical example cases are presented in this section as the validation of lammpsFoam. In
Case 1, a sand bed is fluidized by airflow in the upward direction with a gradually increasing and
decreasing velocity, aiming at capturing the fluidized velocity and pressure drop. In Case 2, a
similar simulation is performed with Case 1, but the fluidized bed is made of Perspex and the
airflow velocity is constant. The volume fraction of the fluid and the time-averaged Eulerian
velocity of particles are presented in this case.

\subsection{Case 1: fluidized bed with constant air flow velocity}

\subsection{Case 2: fluidized bed with oscillating air flow velocity}

\subsection{Code validation part}

In this part, the results of different versions of code are compared to see if the modification of
the code makes any sense.
