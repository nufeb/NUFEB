# This simple example shows how to do basic rendering and pipeline
# creation. It also demonstrates the use of the LODActor.
#
# We start off by loading some Tcl modules. One is the basic VTK library;
# the second is a package for rendering, and the last includes a set
# of color definitions.
#
package require vtk
package require vtkinteraction
package require vtktesting

# This creates a polygonal cylinder model with eight circumferential facets.
#
vtkSTLReader part
    part SetFileName "$VTK_DATA_ROOT/Data/42400-IDGH.stl"

# The mapper is responsible for pushing the geometry into the graphics
# library. It may also do color mapping, if scalars or other attributes
# are defined.
#
vtkPolyDataMapper partMapper
    partMapper SetInputConnection [part GetOutputPort]

# The LOD actor is a special type of actor. It will change appearance in
# order to render faster. At the highest resolution, it renders ewverything
# just like an actor. The middle level is a point cloud, and the lowest
# level is a simple bounding box.
vtkLODActor partActor
    partActor SetMapper partMapper
    eval [partActor GetProperty] SetColor $light_grey
    partActor RotateX  30.0
    partActor RotateY -45.0

# Create the graphics structure. The renderer renders into the
# render window. The render window interactor captures mouse events
# and will perform appropriate camera or actor manipulation
# depending on the nature of the events.
#
vtkRenderer ren1
vtkRenderWindow renWin
    renWin AddRenderer ren1
vtkRenderWindowInteractor iren
    iren SetRenderWindow renWin

# Add the actors to the renderer, set the background and size
#
ren1 AddActor partActor
ren1 SetBackground 0.1 0.2 0.4
renWin SetSize 200 200

# The next line associates a Tcl proc with a "keypress-u" event
# in the rendering window. In this case the proc deiconifies the
# .vtkInteract Tk form that was defined when we loaded
# "package require vtkinteraction".
iren AddObserver UserEvent {wm deiconify .vtkInteract}

# This starts the event loop and as a side effect causes an initial render.
iren Initialize

# We'll zoom in a little by accessing the camera and invoking a "Zoom"
# method on it.
ren1 ResetCamera
[ren1 GetActiveCamera] Zoom 1.5
renWin Render

# prevent the tk window from showing up then start the event loop
wm withdraw .
iren Start
