# Delaunay3D is used to triangulate the points. The Tolerance is the distance
# that nearly coincident points are merged together. (Delaunay does better if
# points are well spaced.) The alpha value is the radius of circumcircles,
# circumspheres. Any mesh entity whose circumcircle is smaller than this
# value is output.
