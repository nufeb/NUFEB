These examples demonstrate some basic VTK concepts. They are organized in
increasing order of complexity. These examples are described in more detail
in the textbook "The Visualization Toolkit An Object-Oriented Approach to 3D
Graphics" Third Edition available for purchase from Kitware. The examples are
implemented in the programming languages C++, Tcl, Python, and Java. (Note:
in order to use Tcl, Python, and/or Java, you will need to compile with
wrapping on.)

Step1 - A "Hello World" style example of a simple visualization pipeline
Step2 - Adding observers to Step1 (i.e., processing events)
Step3 - Rendering with multiple renderers
Step4 - Modifying properties and transformations
Step5 - Specifying a particular interaction style
Step6 - Adding a 3D widget

Once you finish this mini-tutorial, you may wish to explore the other
VTK/Examples/ subdirectories. In particular, the VTK/Examples/Rendering
and VTK/Examples/VisualizationAlgorithms are worth exploring. The
subdirectory VTK/Examples/GUI has other 3D widget examples.
