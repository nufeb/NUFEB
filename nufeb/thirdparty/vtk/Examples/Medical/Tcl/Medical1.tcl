# Create the renderer, the render window, and the interactor. The renderer
# draws into the render window, the interactor enables mouse- and

# The following reader is used to read a series of 2D slices (images)
# that compose the volume. The slice dimensions are set, and the
# pixel spacing. The data Endianness must also be specified. The reader
# usese the FilePrefix in combination with the slice number to construct
# filenames using the format FilePrefix.%d. (In this case the FilePrefix
# is the root name of the file: quarter.)

# clips out objects behind the plane. This way only what is drawn
# between the planes is actually rendered.
