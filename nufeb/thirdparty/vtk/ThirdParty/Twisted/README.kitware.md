# Twisted fork for vtk/ParaView

This branch contains changes required to embed Twisted into vtk/ParaView. This
includes choosing a sub-set without documentation, testing, and unused
modules, and adding CMake build files. Depends on constantly, incremental, and
zope.interface.

Use https://gitlab.kitware.com/third-party/twisted and update.sh to get new
versions of Twisted. See [Updating][../UPDATING.md] for details.
