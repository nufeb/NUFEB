NUFEB is an open source tool for Individual-based Model (IbM) simulation. 
The tool is based on the Individual-based Modelling (IbM) approach, 
where microbes are represented as discrete units and their
behaviour changes over time due to a variety of processes. 

NUFEB is built on top of the molecular dynamics simulator
LAMMPS (as a LAMMPS' user package), extended with IbM features. 
A wide range of biological, physical and
chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems. 

NUFEB is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the terms
of the GNU Public License.

NUFEB development has been funded by the UK’s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 
Newcastle University Frontiers in Engineering Biology (NUFEB) project.
