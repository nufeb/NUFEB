NUFEB (Newcastle University Frontier in Engineering Biology) is an open source tool for 3D individual-based simulation of microbial communities.
The tool is built on top of the molecular dynamic simulator [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov), and extended with features for microbial modelling. 
For more details about NUFEB software and model look at our [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007125).

NUFEB is distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License. The development has been funded by the UKâ€™s EPSRC EP/K039083/1 Frontiers in Engineering Biology project.

Installation guide, tutorial, example videos, and more details can be found in [NUFEB Wiki page](https://github.com/nufeb/NUFEB/wiki) and

### Getting source
Get NUFEB source code and submodules for its thirdparty libraries:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/nufeb/NUFEB --recursive
</pre>

### Building
NUFEB requires gcc/g++ and openmpi for a successful build.

Build NUFEB:
<pre>
./install.sh
</pre>

### Running
Run a case in /examples after building NUFEB, for example:
<pre>
cd examples/biofilm-simple
mpirun -np 4 lmp_mpi -in Inputscript.lammps
</pre>
